      follows are three distinct parts that can be read either independently or as a connected
      whole. Part 1 is about the purpose and importance of having principles in general, having
      nothing to do with mine. Part 2 explains my most fundamental life principles that apply to
      everything I do. Part 3, explains my management principles as they are being lived out at
      Bridgewater. Since my management principles are simply my most fundamental life principles
      applied to management, reading Part 2 will help you to better understand Part 3, but it’s not
      required—you can go directly to Part 3 to see what my management principles are and how
      Bridgewater has been run. One day I’d like to write a Part 4 on my investment principles. If
      you are in looking to get the most bang for your buck (i.e., understanding for the effort), I
      suggest that you read Parts 1 and 2, and the beginning of Part 3 (through the Summary and
      Table of Principles) which will give you nearly the whole picture. It’s only about 55 pages
      of a normal size book.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="2"><span class="styled-text styled-text--italic">Above
      all else, I want you to think for yourself—to decide 1) what you want, 2) what is true and 3)
      what to do about it. I want you to do that in a clear-headed thoughtful way, so that you get
      what</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--italic styled-text--underline">you</span>
      <span class="styled-text styled-text--italic">want. I wrote this book to help you do that. I
      am going to ask only two things of you—1) that you be open-minded and 2) that you honestly
      answer some questions about what you want, what is true and what you want to do about it. If
      you do these things, I believe that you will get a lot out of this book. If you can’t do
      these things, you should reflect on why that is, because you probably have discovered one of
      your greatest impediments to getting what you want out of life.</span></p>

      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="4"><span class="styled-text">Principles are concepts
      that can be applied over and over again in similar circumstances as distinct from narrow
      answers to specific questions. Every game has principles that successful players master to
      achieve winning results. So does life. Principles are ways of successfully dealing with the
      laws of nature or the laws of life. Those who understand more of them and understand them
      well know how to interact with the world more effectively than those who know fewer of them
      or know them less well. Different principles apply to different aspects of life—e.g., there
      are “skiing principles” for skiing, “parenting principles” for parenting, “management
      principles” for managing, “investment principles” for investing, etc and there are
      over-arching “life principles” that influence our approaches to all things. And, of course,
      different people subscribe to different principles that they believe work best.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="5"><span class="styled-text">I am confident that
      whatever success Bridgewater and I have had has resulted from our operating by certain
      principles. Creating a great culture, finding the right people, managing them to do great
      things, and solving problems creatively and systematically are challenges faced by all
      organizations. What differentiates them is how they approach these challenges. The principles
      laid out in the pages that follow convey our unique ways of doing these things, which are the
      reasons for our unique results. Bridgewater’s success has resulted from talented people
      operating by the principles set out here, and it will continue if these or other talented
      people continue to operate by them. Like getting fit, virtually anyone can do it if they are
      willing to do what it takes.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="6"><span class="styled-text">What is written here is
      just my understanding of what it takes: my most fundamental life principles, my approach to
      getting what I want, and my “management principles,” which are based on those foundations.
      Taken together, these principles are meant to paint a picture of a process for the systematic
      pursuit of truth and excellence and for the rewards that accompany this pursuit. I put them
      in writing for people to consider in order to help Bridgewater and the people I care about
      most.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="7"><span class="styled-text">Until recently, I didn’t
      write out these principles because I felt that it was presumptuous for me to tell others what
      would work best for them. But over time, I saw the people who I cared about most struggling
      with problems and wanted to help them; I also found that their problems were almost always
      the result of violating one or more of these principles, and that their problems could be
      solved by applying these principles. So I began writing down the types of problems and the
      broken principles that caused them. When I began, I didn’t know how many principles I would
      end up with but, through this process, I discovered that about 200 principles pretty much
      cover all the problems.</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="Since I learned these principles by encountering reality and reflecting on my encounters, and I am still doing these things, I expect there are more principles to come. So I am still creating this document by throwing various thoughts down when they occur to me, trying to put them in some sensible order and trying to smooth over the bumps. Organizing these principles into a sensible order is a challenge since they relate to each other more like a matrix than as a sequence. To help guide you, I’ve tried to organize them around large themes like building a great culture, managing people well, and creative problem-solving. I will continue these things, so this is an evolving document." data-trigger="footnote"></button> <span class="styled-text">I’m sure that I will come up with
      more as I learn more.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="8"><span class="styled-text">When I say that these are
      my principles, I don’t mean that in a possessive or egotistical way. I just mean that they
      are explanations of what I personally believe. I believe that the people I work with and care
      about must think for themselves. I set these principles out and explained the logic behind
      them so that we can together explore their merits and stress test them. While I am confident
      that these principles work well because I have thought hard about them, they have worked well
      for me for many years, and they have stood up to the scrutiny of the hundreds of smart,
      skeptical people, I also believe that nothing is certain. I believe that the best we can hope
      for is highly probable. By putting them out there and stress testing them, the probabilities
      of their being right will increase.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="9"><span class="styled-text">I also believe that those
      principles that are most valuable to each of us come from our own encounters with reality and
      our reflections on these encounters not from being taught and simply accepting someone else’s
      principles. So, I put these out there for you to reflect on when you are encountering your
      realities, and not for you to blindly follow. What I hope for most is that you and others
      will carefully consider them and try operating by them as part of your process for
      discovering what works best for you. Through this exploration, and with their increased
      usage, not only will they be understood, but they will evolve from “Ray’s principles” to “our
      principles,” and Ray will fade out of the picture in much the same way as memories of one’s
      ski or tennis instructor fade and people only pay attention to what works.</span>
      <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="While this particular document will always express just what I believe, others will certainly have their own principles, and possibly even their own principles documents, and future managers of Bridgewater will work in their own ways to determine what principles Bridgewater will operate by. At most, this will remain as one reference of principles for people to consider when they are deciding what’s important and how to behave." data-trigger="footnote"></button> <span class="styled-text">So, when digesting each
      principle, please…</span></p>
      <figure class="center" data-globalid="10">
        <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">…ask yourself: “Is it true?”</span>
      </figure>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="11"><span class="styled-text">Before I discuss the
      management principles themselves, it’s important for me to articulate my own most fundamental
      life principles because my management principles are an extension of them.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="12"><span class="styled-text">In Part 1, I explain what
      I mean by principles, why I believe they are important, and how they are essential for
      getting what you want out of life.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="13"><span class="styled-text">Part 2 explains my most
      fundamental life principles. I describe what I believe are the best ways of interacting with
      reality to learn what it’s like, and how to most effectively deal with it to get what you
      want. I also discuss what I believe are the most common traps that people fall into that
      prevent them from getting what they want, and how people’s lives can be radically better by
      avoiding them. I wrote this so you can better understand why my other principles are what
      they are, though you don’t need to read this part to understand the others.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="14"><span class="styled-text">Part 3 is about my
      management principles. As I have run Bridgewater for more than 35 years, it explains
      Bridgewater’s approach up till now. It begins at the big-picture, conceptual level, with an
      explanation of why I believe that any company’s results are primarily determined by its
      people and its culture. It then drills down into what I believe are the important principles
      behind creating a great culture hiring the right people, managing them to achieve excellence,
      solving problems systematically, and making good decisions.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="15"><span class="styled-text">There are of course lots
      of other types of principles. For example, I hope to one day write about my investment
      principles. However, management principles are now what we need most, so here are the ones
      that I think make sense and have worked for me.</span></p>

      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="18"><span class="styled-text">We will begin by examining

      <p class="commentary commentary-indent" data-globalid="19"><span class="styled-text styled-text--italic">What are
      principles?</span> <span class="styled-text"></span></p>
      <p class="commentary commentary-indent" data-globalid="20"><span class="styled-text styled-text--italic">Why are
      principles important?</span> <span class="styled-text"></span></p>
      <p class="commentary commentary-indent" data-globalid="21"><span class="styled-text styled-text--italic">Where do
      principles come from?</span> <span class="styled-text"></span></p>
      <p class="commentary commentary-indent" data-globalid="22"><span class="styled-text styled-text--italic">Do you
      have principles that you live your life by? What are they?</span> <span class="styled-text"></span></p>
      <p class="commentary commentary-indent" data-globalid="23"><span class="styled-text styled-text--italic">How well
      do you think they will work, and why?</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="24"><span class="styled-text">Answer all questions with
      complete honesty, without worrying what I or others might think. That honesty will allow you
      to be comfortable living with your own principles, and to judge yourself by how consistently
      you operate by them. If you don’t have many well-thought-out principles, don’t worry. We will
      get there together, if we remain open-minded.</span></p>
      <p class="number styled-text--sans-serif" data-globalid="25" data-level="1" data-text="1"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold styled-text--sans-serif">What are principles?</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="26"><span class="styled-text">Your values are what you
      consider important, literally what you “value.” Principles are what allow you to live a life
      consistent with those values. Principles connect your values to your actions; they are
      beacons that guide your actions, and help you successfully deal with the laws of reality. It
      is to your principles that you turn when you face hard choices.</span></p>
      <p class="number styled-text--sans-serif" data-globalid="27" data-level="1" data-text="2"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold styled-text--sans-serif">Why are principles important?</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="28"><span class="styled-text">All successful people
      operate by principles that help them be successful. Without principles, you would be forced
      to react to circumstances that come at you without considering what you value most and how to
      make choices to get what you want. This would prevent you from making the most of your life.
      While operating without principles is bad for individuals, it is even worse for groups of
      individuals (such as companies) because it leads to people randomly bumping into each other
      without understanding their own values and how to behave in order to be consistent with those
      values.</span></p>
      <p class="number styled-text--sans-serif" data-globalid="29" data-level="1" data-text="3"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold styled-text--sans-serif">Where do principles come from?</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="30"><span class="styled-text">Sometimes we forge our own
      principles and sometimes we accept others’ principles, or holistic packages of principles,
      such as religion and legal systems. While it isn’t necessarily a bad thing to use others’
      principles—it’s difficult to come up with your own, and often much wisdom has gone into those
      already created—</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">adopting pre-packaged
      principles without much thought exposes you to the risk of inconsistency with your true
      values</span><span class="styled-text">. Holding incompatible principles can lead to
      conflict between values and actions—like the hypocrite who has claims to be of a religion yet
      behaves counter to its teachings. Your principles need to reflect values you really believe
      in.</span></p>
      <p class="number styled-text--sans-serif" data-globalid="31" data-level="1" data-text="4"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">Do you have principles that you live your life by? What are
      they?</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="32"><span class="styled-text">Your principles will
      determine your standards of behavior. When you enter into relationships with other people,
      your and their principles will determine how you interact. People who have shared values and
      principles get along. People who don’t will suffer through constant misunderstanding and
      conflicts with one another. Too often in relationships, people’s principles are unclear.
      Think about the people with whom you are closest. Are their values aligned with
      yours?</span></p>
      <p class="question" data-globalid="33" data-id="1"><span class="styled-text">What do you
      value most deeply?</span></p>
      <p class="number styled-text--sans-serif" data-globalid="34" data-level="1" data-text="5"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">How well do you think they will work, and why?</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="35"><span class="styled-text">Those principles that are
      most valuable come from our own experiences and our reflections on those experiences. Every
      time we face hard choices, we refine our principles by asking ourselves difficult questions.
      For example, when our representatives in Washington are investigating whether various
      segments of society are behaving ethically, they are simultaneously grappling with questions
      such as, “Should the government punish people for bad ethics, or should it just write and
      enforce the laws?” Questions of this kind—in this case, about the nature of government—prompt
      thoughtful assessments of alternative approaches. These assessments in turn lead to
      principles that can be applied to similar occasions in the future. As another example, “I
      won’t steal” can be a principle to which you refer when the choice of whether or not to steal
      arises. But to be most effective, each principle must be consistent with your values, and
      this consistency demands that you ask: Why? Is the reason you won’t steal because you feel
      empathy for your potential victim? Is it because you fear getting caught? By asking such
      questions, we refine our understanding, and the development of our principles becomes better
      aligned with our core values. To be successful, you must make correct, tough choices. You
      must be able to “cut off a leg to save a life,” both on an individual level and, if you lead
      people, on a group level. And to be a great leader, it is important to remember that you will
      have to make these choices by understanding and caring for your people, not by following
      them.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="36"><span class="styled-text">You have to answer these
      questions for yourself. What I hope for most is that you will carefully consider the
      principles we will be exploring in this document and try operating by them as part of the
      process of discovering what works best for you. In time, the answers to these questions will
      evolve from “Ray’s principles” to “my principles,” and “Ray” will fade from the picture in
      much the same way as memories of your ski instructor or basketball coach fade after you have
      mastered the sport.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="37"><span class="styled-text">So, as I believe that
      adopting pre-packaged principles without much thought is risky, I am asking you to join me in
      thoughtfully discussing the principles that guide how we act. When considering each
      principle, please ask yourself,</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">“Is it
      true?”</span> <span class="styled-text">While this particular document will always express
      just what I believe, other people will certainly have their own principles, and possibly even
      their own principles documents, and future managers of Bridgewater will work in their own
      ways to determine what principles Bridgewater will operate by. At most, this will remain as
      one reference of principles for people to consider when they are deciding what’s important
      and how to behave.</span></p>

      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="42"><span class="styled-text">Since we are all products
      of our genes and our environments and approach the world with biases, I think it is relevant
      for me to tell you a bit of my background so that you can know where I’m coming
      from.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="43"><span class="styled-text">I grew up in a
      middle-class neighborhood on Long Island, the only son of a jazz musician and a stay-at-home
      mom. I was a very ordinary kid, and a less-than-ordinary student. I liked playing with my
      friends—for example, touch football in the street—and I didn't like the school part of
      school, partly because I had, and still have, a bad rote memory</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="Rote memory is memory for things that don’t have an intrinsic logic for being what they are, like a random series of numbers, words in a foreign language and people’s names (all of which I have trouble with). On the other hand, I have a great memory for things that make sense in a context. For example, I can tell you what happened in every year in the economy and markets since the mid-1960s and how many things work." data-trigger="footnote"></button> <span class="styled-text">and partly because I couldn’t get
      excited about forcing myself to remember what others wanted me to remember without
      understanding what all this work was going to get me. In order to be motivated, I needed to
      work for what I wanted, not for what other people wanted me to do. And in order to be
      successful, I needed to figure out for myself how to get what I wanted, not remember the
      facts I was being told to remember.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="44"><span class="styled-text">One thing I wanted was
      spending money. So I had a newspaper route, I mowed lawns, I shoveled the snow off driveways,
      I washed dishes in a restaurant, and, starting when I was 12 years old, I caddied.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="45"><span class="styled-text">It was the 1960s. At the
      time the stock market was booming and everyone was talking about it, especially the people I
      caddied for. So I started to invest. The first stock I bought was a company called Northeast
      Airlines, and the only reason I bought it was that it was the only company I had heard of
      that was trading for less than $5 per share, so I could buy more shares, which I figured was
      a good thing. It went up a lot. It was about to go broke but another company acquired it, so
      it tripled. I made money because I was lucky, though I didn’t see it that way then. I figured
      that this game was easy. After all, with thousands of companies listed in the newspaper, how
      difficult could it be to find at least one that would go up? By comparison to my other jobs,
      this way of making money seemed much more fun, a lot easier, and much more lucrative. Of
      course, it didn’t take me long to lose money in the markets and learn about how difficult it
      is to be right and the costs of being wrong.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="46"><span class="styled-text">So what I really wanted to
      do now was beat the market. I just had to figure out how to do it.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="47"><span class="styled-text">The pursuit of this goal taught me:</span></p>
      <p class="number" data-globalid="48" data-level="1" data-text="1"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">It isn’t easy for me to be confident that my opinions are
      right.</span> <span class="styled-text">In the markets, you can do a huge amount of work and
      still be wrong.</span></p>
      <p class="number" data-globalid="49" data-level="1" data-text="2"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">Bad opinions can be very costly.</span> <span class="styled-text">Most people come up with opinions and there’s no cost to them. Not so in the
      market. This is why I have learned to be cautious. No matter how hard I work, I really can’t
      be sure.</span></p>
      <p class="number" data-globalid="50" data-level="1" data-text="3"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">The consensus is often wrong, so I have to be an independent
      thinker.</span> <span class="styled-text">To make any money, you have to be right when
      they’re wrong.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary so" data-globalid="51"><span class="styled-text">So …</span></p>
      <p class="number" data-globalid="52" data-level="1" data-text="1"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">I worked for what I wanted, not for what others wanted me to
      do.</span> <span class="styled-text">For that reason, I never felt that I had to do anything.
      All the work I ever did was just what I needed to do to get what I wanted. Since I always had
      the prerogative to strive for what I wanted, I never felt forced to do anything.</span></p>
      <p class="number" data-globalid="53" data-level="1" data-text="2"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">I came up with the best independent opinions I could muster
      to get what I wanted.</span> <span class="styled-text">For example, when I wanted to make
      money in the markets, I knew that I had to learn about companies to assess the attractiveness
      of their stocks. At the time,</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--italic">Fortune</span> <span class="styled-text">magazine had a
      little tear-out-coupon that you could mail in to get the annual reports of any companies on
      the Fortune 500, for free. So I ordered all the annual reports and worked my way through the
      most interesting ones and formed opinions</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="The way I learn is to immerse myself in something, which prompts questions, which I answer, prompting more questions, until I reach a conclusion." data-trigger="footnote"></button> <span class="styled-text">about which companies were
      exciting</span></p>
      <p class="number" data-globalid="54" data-level="1" data-text="3"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">I stress-tested my opinions by having the smartest people I
      could find challenge them so I could find out where I was wrong.<button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="This included my retail stockbroker, the people I was caddying for, even my local barber, who was equally engrossed in the stock market. (It wasn’t as precocious as it sounds. At the time, instead of talking about the Yankees, everyone was talking about stocks. That was the world I grew up in.)" data-trigger="footnote"></button></span> <span class="styled-text">I never cared much about others’
      conclusions—only for the reasoning that led to these conclusions. That reasoning had to make
      sense to me. Through this process, I improved my chances of being right, and I learned a lot
      from a lot of great people.</span></p>
      <p class="number" data-globalid="55" data-level="1" data-text="4"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">I remained wary about being overconfident, and I figured out
      how to effectively deal with my not knowing.</span> <span class="styled-text">I dealt with my
      not knowing by either continuing to gather information until I reached the point that I could
      be confident or by eliminating my exposure to the risks of not knowing.</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="Sometimes when I know that I don’t know which way the coin is going to flip, I try to position myself so that it won’t have an impact on me either way. In other words, I don’t make an inadvertent bet. I try to limit my bets to the limited number of things I am confident in." data-trigger="footnote"></button></p>
      <p class="number" data-globalid="56" data-level="1" data-text="5"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">I wrestled with my realities, reflected on the consequences
      of my decisions, and learned and improved from this process.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="57"><span class="styled-text">By doing these things, I
      learned how important and how liberating it is to think for myself.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="58"><span class="styled-text">In a nutshell, this is the
      whole approach that I believe will work best for you—the best summary of what I want the
      people who are working with me to do in order to accomplish great things.</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">I want you to work for yourself, to come up with independent
      opinions, to stress-test them, to be wary about being overconfident, and to reflect on the
      consequences of your decisions and constantly improve.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="59"><span class="styled-text">After I graduated from
      high school, I went to a local college that I barely got in to. I loved it, unlike high
      school, because I could learn about things that interested me; I studied because I enjoyed
      it, not because I had to.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="60"><span class="styled-text">At that time the Beatles
      had made a trip to India to learn how to meditate, which triggered my interest, so I learned
      how to meditate. It helped me think more clearly and creatively, so I’m sure that enhanced my
      enjoyment of, and success at, learning.</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="By the way, I still meditate and I still find it helpful." data-trigger="footnote"></button>
      <span class="styled-text">Unlike in high school, in college I did very well.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="61"><span class="styled-text">And of course I continued
      to trade markets. Around this time I became interested in trading commodities futures, though
      virtually nobody traded them back then. I was attracted to trading them just because they had
      low margin requirements so I figured I could make more money by being right (which I planned
      to be).</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="62"><span class="styled-text">By the time I graduated
      college, in 1971, I had been admitted to Harvard Business School, where I would go in the
      fall. That summer between college and HBS I clerked on the floor of the New York Stock
      Exchange. This was the summer of the breakdown of the global monetary system (i.e., the
      Bretton Woods system). It was one of the most dramatic economic events ever and I was at the
      epicenter of it, so it thrilled me. It was a currency crisis that drove all market behaviors,
      so I delved into understanding the currency markets. The currency markets would be important
      to me for the rest of my life.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="63"><span class="styled-text">That fall I went to
      Harvard Business School, which I was excited about because I felt that I had climbed to the
      top and would be with the best of the best. Despite these high expectations, the place was
      even better than I expected because the case study method allowed open-ended figuring things
      out and debating with others to get at the best answers, rather than memorizing facts. I
      loved the work-hard, play-hard environment.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="64"><span class="styled-text">In the summer between my
      two years at HBS, I pursued my interest in trading commodities futures by convincing the
      Director of Commodities for Merrill Lynch to give me a job as his assistant. At the time,
      commodities trading was still an obscure thing to do.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="65"><span class="styled-text">In the fall I went back to
      HBS, and in that academic year, 1972-73, trading commodities futures became a hot thing to
      do. That is because the monetary system’s breakdown that occurred in 1971 led to an
      inflationary surge that sent commodity prices higher. As a result of this, the first oil
      shock occurred in 1973. As inflation started to surge, the Federal Reserve tightened monetary
      policy to fight it, so stocks went down in the worst bear market since the Great Depression.
      So, commodities futures trading was hot and stock market investing was not. Naturally,
      brokerage houses that didn’t have commodities trading departments wanted them, and there was
      a shortage of people who knew anything about it. Virtually nobody in the commodities futures
      business had the type of Harvard Business School background that I had. So I was hired as
      Director of Commodities at a moderate-size brokerage and given an old salt who had lots of
      commodities brokerage experience to help me set up a commodities division. The bad stock
      market environment ended up taking this brokerage house down before we could get the
      commodities futures trading going. I went to a bigger, more successful brokerage, where I was
      in charge of its institutional/hedging business. But I didn’t fit into the organization well,
      so I was fired essentially for insubordination.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="66"><span class="styled-text">So in 1975, after a quick
      two-year stint on Wall Street after school, I started Bridgewater. Soon after, I got married
      and began my family.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="67"><span class="styled-text">Through this time and ‘til
      now I followed the same basic approach I used as a 12-year-old caddie trying to beat the
      market, i.e., by</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">1) working for what I
      wanted, not for what others wanted me to do; 2) coming up with the best independent opinions
      I could muster to move toward my goals; 3) stress-testing my opinions by having the smartest
      people I could find challenge them so I could find out where I was wrong; 4) being wary about
      overconfidence, and good at not knowing; and 5) wrestling with reality, experiencing the
      results of my decisions, and reflecting on what I did to produce them so that I could
      improve.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="68"><span class="styled-text">Since I started
      Bridgewater, I have gained a lot more experience that taught me a lot more, mostly by making
      mistakes and learning from them. Most importantly:</span></p>
      <p class="commentary commentary-indent" data-globalid="69"><span class="styled-text">I learned that failure is
      by and large due to not accepting and successfully dealing with the realities of life, and
      that achieving success is simply a matter of accepting and successfully dealing with all my
      realities.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary commentary-indent" data-globalid="70"><span class="styled-text">I learned that finding out
      what is true, regardless of what that is, including all the stuff most people think is
      bad—like mistakes and personal weaknesses—is good because I can then deal with these things
      so that they don’t stand in my way.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary commentary-indent" data-globalid="71"><span class="styled-text">I learned that there is
      nothing to fear from truth. While some truths can be scary—for example, finding out that you
      have a deadly disease—knowing them allows us to deal with them better. Being truthful, and
      letting others be completely truthful, allows me and others to fully explore our thoughts and
      exposes us to the feedback that is essential for our learning.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary commentary-indent" data-globalid="72"><span class="styled-text">I learned that being
      truthful was an extension of my freedom to be me. I believe that people who are one way on
      the inside and believe that they need to be another way outside to please others become
      conflicted and often lose touch with what they really think and feel. It’s difficult for them
      to be happy and almost impossible for them to be at their best. I know that’s true for
      me.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary commentary-indent" data-globalid="73"><span class="styled-text">I learned that I want the
      people I deal with to say what they really believe and to listen to what others say in reply,
      in order to find out what is true. I learned that one of the greatest sources of problems in
      our society arises from people having loads of wrong theories in their heads—often theories
      that are critical of others—that they won’t test by speaking to the relevant people about
      them. Instead, they talk behind people’s backs, which leads to pervasive misinformation. I
      learned to hate this because I could see that making judgments about people so that they are
      tried and sentenced in your head, without asking them for their perspective, is both
      unethical and unproductive.</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="It is unethical because a basic principle of justice is that everyone has the right to face his accuser. And it is unproductive because it does not lead to the exploration of “Is it true?” which can lead to understanding and improvement." data-trigger="footnote"></button> <span class="styled-text">So I learned to love real
      integrity (saying the same things as one believes)</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="I do not mean that you should say everything you think, just that what you do say matches your thoughts." data-trigger="footnote"></button> <span class="styled-text">and to despise the lack of
      it.</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="The word “integrity” is from the Latin root “integer,” which means “one” i.e., that you are the same inside and out. Most people would be insulted if you told them that they don&#39;t have integrity--but how many people do you know who tell people what they really think?" data-trigger="footnote"></button> <span class="styled-text"></span></p>
      <p class="commentary commentary-indent" data-globalid="74"><span class="styled-text">I learned that everyone
      makes mistakes and has weaknesses and that one of the most important things that
      differentiates people is their approach to handling them. I learned that there is an
      incredible beauty to mistakes because embedded in each mistake is a puzzle, and a gem that I
      could get if I solved it, i.e., a principle that I could use to reduce my mistakes in the
      future. I learned that each mistake was probably a reflection of something that I was (or
      others were) doing wrong, so if I could figure out what that was, I could learn how to be
      more effective. I learned that wrestling with my problems, mistakes, and weaknesses was the
      training that strengthened me. Also, I learned that it was the pain of this wrestling that
      made me and those around me appreciate our successes.</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="I believe that our society&#39;s “mistakephobia” is crippling, a problem that begins in most elementary schools, where we learn to learn what we are taught rather than to form our own goals and to figure out how to achieve them. We are fed with facts and tested and those who make the fewest mistakes are considered to be the smart ones, so we learn that it is embarrassing to not know and to make mistakes. Our education system spends virtually no time on how to learn from mistakes, yet this is critical to real learning. As a result, school typically doesn’t prepare young people for real life--unless their lives are spent following instructions and pleasing others. In my opinion, that’s why so many students who succeed in school fail in life." data-trigger="footnote"></button></p>
      <p class="commentary commentary-indent" data-globalid="75"><span class="styled-text">I learned that the popular
      picture of success—which is like a glossy photo of an ideal man or woman out of a Ralph
      Lauren catalog, with a bio attached listing all of their accomplishments like going to the
      best prep schools and an Ivy League college, and getting all the answers right on tests—is an
      inaccurate picture of the typical successful person. I met a number of great people and
      learned that none of them were born great—they all made lots of mistakes and had lots
      weaknesses—and that great people become great by looking at their mistakes and weaknesses and
      figuring out how to get around them. So I learned that the people who make the most of the
      process of encountering reality, especially the painful obstacles, learn the most and get
      what they want faster than people who do not. I learned that they are the great ones—the ones
      I wanted to have around me.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary commentary-indent" data-globalid="76"><span class="styled-text">In short, I learned that
      being totally truthful, especially about mistakes and weaknesses, led to a rapid rate of
      improvement and movement toward what I wanted.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="77"><span class="styled-text">While this approach worked
      great for me, I found it more opposite than similar to most others’ approaches, which has
      produced communications challenges.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary">Specifically, I found that:</p>
      <p class="commentary commentary-indent" data-globalid="78"><span class="styled-text">While most others seem to
      believe that learning what we are taught is the path to success, I believe that figuring out
      for yourself what you want and how to get it is a better path.</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="After all, isn’t the point of learning to help you get what you want? So don’t you have to start with what you want and figure out what you have to learn in order to get it?" data-trigger="footnote"></button> <span class="styled-text"></span></p>
      <p class="commentary commentary-indent" data-globalid="79"><span class="styled-text">While most others seem to
      believe that having answers is better than having questions, I believe that having questions
      is better than having answers because it leads to more learning.</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="In fact I believe that most people who are quick to come up with answers simply haven’t thought about all the ways that they can be wrong." data-trigger="footnote"></button></p>
      <p class="commentary commentary-indent" data-globalid="80"><span class="styled-text">While most others seem to
      believe that mistakes are bad things, I believe mistakes are good things because I believe
      that most learning comes via making mistakes and reflecting on them.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary commentary-indent" data-globalid="81"><span class="styled-text">While most others seem to
      believe that finding out about one’s weaknesses is a bad thing, I believe that it is a good
      thing because it is the first step toward finding out what to do about them and not letting
      them stand in your way.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary commentary-indent" data-globalid="82"><span class="styled-text">While most others seem to
      believe that pain is bad, I believe that pain is required to become stronger.</span>
      <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="I don’t mean that the more pain the better. I believe that too much pain can break someone and that the absence of pain typically prevents growth so that one should accept the amount of pain that is consistent with achieving one’s objectives." data-trigger="footnote"></button></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="83"><span class="styled-text">One of the advantages of
      my being over 60 years old—and there aren’t many—is that we can look back on my story to see
      how I came by these beliefs and how they have worked for me. It is now more than 35 years a
      after I started Bridgewater and about the same number of years since I got married and began
      my family. I am obviously not your Ralph Lauren poster child for success, yet I’ve had a lot
      of successes, though they’re probably not what you’re thinking.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="84"><span class="styled-text">Yes, I started Bridgewater
      from scratch, and now it’s a uniquely successful company and I am on the Forbes 400 list. But
      these results were never my goals—they were just residual outcomes—so my getting them can’t
      be indications of my success. And, quite frankly, I never found them very rewarding.</span>
      <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="I have been very lucky because I have had the opportunity to see what it’s like to have little or no money and what it’s like to have a lot of it. I’m lucky because people make such a big deal of it and, if I didn’t experience both, I wouldn’t be able to know how important it really is for me. I can’t comment on what having a lot of money means to others, but I do know that for me, having a lot more money isn’t a lot better than having enough to cover the basics. That’s because, for me, the best things in life--meaningful work, meaningful relationships, interesting experiences, good food, sleep, music, ideas, sex, and other basic needs and pleasures--are not, past a certain point, materially improved upon by having a lot of money. For me, money has always been very important to the point that I could have these basics covered and never very important beyond that. That doesn’t mean that I don’t think that having more is good–it’s just that I don’t think it’s a big deal. So, while I spend money on some very expensive things that cost multiples relative to the more fundamental things, these expensive things have never brought me much enjoyment relative to the much cheaper, more fundamental things. They were just like cherries on the cake. For my tastes, if I had to choose, I’d rather be a backpacker who is exploring the world with little money than a big income earner who is in a job I don’t enjoy. (Though being in a job that provides me with what I want is best of all, for me). Also, from having come from having next-to-nothing to having a lot, I have developed a strong belief that, all things being equal, offering equal opportunity is fundamental to being good, while handing out money to capable people that weakens their need to get stronger and contribute to society is bad." data-trigger="footnote"></button></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="85"><span class="styled-text">What I wanted was to have
      an interesting, diverse life filled with lots of learning—and especially meaningful work and
      meaningful relationships. I feel that I have gotten these in abundance and I am happy. And I
      feel that I got what I wanted by following the same basic approach I used as a 12-year-old
      caddie trying to beat the market, i.e., by 1) working for what I wanted, not for what others
      wanted me to do; 2) coming up with the best independent opinions I could muster to move

      and reflecting on what I did to produce them so that I could improve. I believe that by
      following this approach I moved faster to my goals by learning a lot more than if I hadn’t
      followed it.</span></p>

      encountered realities, often in the form of problems, and I had to make decisions. I found
      that if I accepted the realities rather than wished that they didn’t exist and if I learned
      how to work with them rather than fight them, I could figure out how to get to my goals. It
      might take repeated tries, and seeking the input of others, but I could eventually get there.
      As a result, I have become someone who believes that we need to deeply understand, accept,
      and work with reality in order to get what we want out of life. Whether it is knowing how
      people</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">really</span> <span class="styled-text">think and behave when dealing with them, or how things</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">really</span> <span class="styled-text">work on a material
      level—so that if we do X then Y will happen—understanding reality gives us the power to get
      what we want out of life, or at least to dramatically improve our odds of success. In other
      words, I have become a “hyperrealist.”</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="89"><span class="styled-text">When I say I’m a
      hyperrealist, people sometimes think I don’t believe in making dreams happen. This couldn’t
      be further from the truth. In fact, I believe that without pursuing dreams, life is mundane.
      I am just saying that I believe hyperrealism is the best way to choose and achieve one’s
      dreams. The people who really change the world are the ones who see what’s possible and
      figure out how to make that happen. I believe that dreamers who simply imagine things that
      would be nice but are not possible don’t sufficiently appreciate the laws of the universe to
      understand the true implications of their desires, much less how to achieve them.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="90"><span class="styled-text">Let me explain what I
      mean.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="91"><span class="styled-text">I believe there are an
      infinite number of laws of the universe and that all progress or dreams achieved come from
      operating in a way that’s consistent with them. These laws and the principles of how to
      operate in harmony with them have always existed. We were given these laws by nature. Man
      didn’t and can’t make them up. He can only hope to understand them and use them to get what
      he wants. For example, the ability to fly or to send cellular phone signals imperceptibly and
      instantaneously around the world or any other new and beneficial developments resulted from
      understanding and using previously existing laws of the universe. These inventions did not
      come from people who were not well-grounded in reality.</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="I recognize that sometimes a discovery is made by accident, but the discovery is of some basic underlying principle that creates understanding of a cause-effect relationship that leads to a desired result." data-trigger="footnote"></button> <span class="styled-text">The same is true for economic,
      political, and social systems that work. Success is achieved by people who deeply understand
      reality and know how to use it to get what they want. The converse is also true: idealists
      who are not well-grounded in reality create problems, not progress. For example, communism
      was a system created by people with good intentions who failed to recognize that their
      idealistic system was inconsistent with human nature. As a result, they caused more harm than
      good.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="92"><span class="styled-text">This brings me to my most
      fundamental principle:</span></p>
      <figure class="center" data-globalid="93">
        <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">Truth</span>
      </figure>
      <figure class="center" data-globalid="94">
        <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">—more precisely, an accurate understanding of
        reality—</span>
      </figure>
      <figure class="center" data-globalid="95">
        <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">is the essential foundation for producing good
        outcomes.</span>
      </figure>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="96"><span class="styled-text">While I spend the most
      time studying how the realities that affect me most work—i.e., those that drive the markets
      and the people I deal with—I also love to study nature to try to figure out how it works
      because, to me, nature is both beautiful and practical.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="97"><span class="styled-text">Its perfection and
      brilliance staggers me. When I think about all the flying machines, swimming machines, and
      billions of other systems that nature created, from the microscopic level to the cosmic
      level, and how they interact with one another to make a workable whole that evolves through
      time and through multi-dimensions, my breath is taken away. It seems to me that, in relation
      to nature, man has the intelligence of a mold growing on an apple—man can’t even make a
      mosquito, let alone scratch the surface of understanding the universe.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="98"><span class="styled-text">Though how nature works is
      way beyond man’s ability to comprehend, I have found that observing how nature works offers
      innumerable lessons that can help us understand the realities that affect us. That is
      because, though man is unique, he is part of nature and subject to most of the same laws of
      nature that affect other species.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="99"><span class="styled-text">For example, I have found
      that by looking at what is rewarded and punished, and why, universally—i.e., in nature as
      well as in humanity—I have been able to learn more about what is “good” and “bad” than by
      listening to most people’s views about good and bad. It seems to me that what most people
      call “good” and “bad” typically reflects their particular group’s preferences: the Taliban’s
      definitions are different from Americans’, which are different from others’—and within each
      group there are differences and they are intended to paint a picture of the world the way
      they’d like it to be rather than the way it really is. So there are many different takes on
      what is good and bad that each group uses to call others “bad” and themselves “good,” some of
      which are practical and others of which are impractical. Yet all of them, and everything
      else, are subject to the same laws of nature–i.e., I believe that we all get rewarded and
      punished according to whether we operate in harmony or in conflict with nature’s laws, and
      that all societies will succeed or fail in the degrees that they operate consistently with
      these laws.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="100"><span class="styled-text">This perspective gives me
      a non-traditional sense of good and bad: “good,” to me, means operating consistently with the
      natural laws, while “bad” means operating inconsistently with these laws. In other words, for
      something to be “good” it must be grounded in reality. And if something is in conflict with
      reality—for example, if morality is in conflict with reality—it is “bad,” i.e., it will not
      produce good outcomes.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="101"><span class="styled-text">In other words, I believe
      that understanding what is good is obtained by looking at the way the world works and
      figuring out how to operate in harmony with it to help it (and yourself) evolve. But it is
      not obvious, and it is sometimes difficult to accept.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="102"><span class="styled-text">For example, when a pack
      of hyenas takes down a young wildebeest, is this good or bad? At face value, this seems
      terrible; the poor wildebeest suffers and dies. Some people might even say that the hyenas
      are evil. Yet this type of apparently evil behavior exists throughout nature through all
      species and was created by nature, which is much smarter than I am, so before I jump to
      pronouncing it evil, I need to try to see if it might be good. When I think about it, like
      death itself, this behavior is integral to the enormously complex and efficient system that
      has worked for as long as there has been life. And when I think of the second- and
      third-order consequences, it becomes obvious that this behavior is good for both the hyenas,
      who are operating in their self-interest, and in the interests of the greater system, which
      includes the wildebeest, because killing and eating the wildebeest fosters evolution, i.e.,
      the natural process of improvement. In fact, if I changed anything about the way that dynamic
      works, the overall outcome would be worse.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="103"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">I
      believe that evolution, which is the natural movement toward better adaptation, is the
      greatest single force in the universe, and that it is good.</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="In fact, it appears to me that everything other than evolution eventually disintegrates and that we all are, and everything else is, vehicles for evolution." data-trigger="footnote"></button> <span class="styled-text">It affects the changes of
      everything from all species to the entire solar system. It is good because evolution is the
      process of adaptation that leads to improvement. So, based on how I observe both nature and
      humanity working, I believe that what is bad and most punished are those things that don’t
      work because they are at odds with the laws of the universe and they impede
      evolution.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="104"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">I
      believe that the desire to evolve, i.e., to get better, is probably humanity’s most pervasive
      driving force.</span> <span class="styled-text">Enjoying your job, a craft, or your favorite
      sport comes from the innate satisfaction of getting better. Though most people typically
      think that they are striving to get things (e.g., toys, better houses, money, status, etc.)
      that will make them happy, that is not usually the case. Instead, when we get the things we
      are striving for, we rarely remain satisfied.</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="Of course, we are often satisfied with the same things – relationships, careers, etc.—but when that is the case, it is typically because we are getting new enjoyments from the new dimensions of these things." data-trigger="footnote"></button> <span class="styled-text">It is natural for us to seek
      other things or to seek to make the things we have better. In the process of this seeking, we
      continue to evolve and we contribute to the evolution of all that we have contact with. The
      things we are striving for are just the bait to get us to chase after them in order to make
      us evolve, and it is the evolution and not the reward itself that matters to us and those
      around us.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="105"><span class="styled-text">It is natural that it
      should be this way—i.e., that our lives are not satisfied by obtaining our goals, but rather
      by striving for them—because of the law of diminishing returns.</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="The marginal benefits of moving from a shortage to an abundance of anything decline." data-trigger="footnote"></button> <span class="styled-text">For example, suppose making a lot
      of money is your goal and suppose you make enough so that making more has no marginal
      utility. Then it would be foolish to continue to have making money be your goal. People who
      acquire things beyond their usefulness not only will derive little or no marginal gains from
      these acquisitions, but they also will experience negative consequences, as with any form of
      gluttony. So, because of the law of diminishing returns, it is only natural that seeking
      something new, or seeking new depths of something old, is required to bring us
      satisfaction.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="106"><span class="styled-text">In other words, the
      sequence of 1) seeking new things (goals); 2) working and learning in the process of pursuing
      these goals; 3) obtaining these goals; and 4) then doing this over and over again is
      the</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">personal evolutionary process</span>
      <span class="styled-text">that fulfills most of us and moves society forward.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="107"><span class="styled-text">I believe that</span>
      <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">pursuing self-interest in harmony with the laws
      of the universe and contributing to evolution is universally rewarded</span> <span class="styled-text">, and what I call “good.” Look at all species in action: they are constantly
      pursuing their own interests and helping evolution in a symbiotic way, with most of them not
      even knowing that their self-serving behaviors are contributing to evolution. Like the hyenas
      attacking the wildebeest, successful people might not even know if or how their pursuit of
      self-interest helps evolution, but it typically does.</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="When pursuing self-interest is in conflict with evolution, it is typically punished." data-trigger="footnote"></button></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="108"><span class="styled-text">Self-interest and
      society’s interests are generally symbiotic: more than anything else, it is pursuit of
      self-interest that motivates people to push themselves to do the difficult things that
      benefit them and that contribute to society. In return, society rewards those who give it
      what it wants. That is why how much money people have earned is a rough measure of how much
      they gave society what it wanted—NOT how much they desired to make money. Look at what caused
      people to make a lot of money and you will see that usually it is in proportion to their
      production of what the society wanted and largely unrelated to their desire to make money.
      There are many people who have made a lot of money who never made making a lot of money their
      primary goal. Instead, they simply engaged in the work that they were doing, produced what
      society wanted, and got rich doing it.</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="Of course, there are many people who give society what it wants but are paid poorly. This is explained by the law of supply and demand." data-trigger="footnote"></button> <span class="styled-text">And there are many people who
      really wanted to make a lot of money but never produced what the society wanted and they
      didn’t make a lot of money. In other words, there is an excellent correlation between giving
      society what it wants and making money, and almost no correlation between the desire to make
      money and how much money one makes. I know that this is true for me—i.e., I never worked to
      make a lot of money, and if I had I would have stopped ages ago because of the law of
      diminishing returns. I know that the same is true for all the successful, healthy (i.e.,
      non-obsessed) people I know.</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="I do know some successful people who are obsessed with making money despite making money having little or no marginal benefit for them." data-trigger="footnote"></button></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="109"><span class="styled-text">This process of
      productive adaptation—i.e., the process of seeking, obtaining, and pursuing new goals—does
      not just pertain to how individuals and society move forward. It is equally relevant when
      dealing with setbacks, which are inevitable. That is why many people who have had setbacks
      that seemed devastating at the time ended up as happy as (or even happier than) they were
      before, once they successfully adapted to them. The faster that one appropriately adapts, the
      better. As Darwin described, adaptation—i.e., adjusting appropriately to changes in one’s
      circumstances—is a big part of the evolutionary process, and it is rewarded.</span>
      <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="Darwin said, “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change.”" data-trigger="footnote"></button> <span class="styled-text">That is why some of the most
      successful people are typically those who see the changing landscape and identify how to best
      adapt to it.</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="Your ability to see the changing landscape and adapt is more a function of your perceptive and reasoning abilities than your ability to learn and process quickly." data-trigger="footnote"></button></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="110"><span class="styled-text">So, it seems to me that
      desires to evolve are universal and so are symbiotic relationships that lead to the evolution
      of the whole via the pursuit of individuals’ self-interests. However, what differentiates man
      from other species is man’s greater ability to learn. Because we can learn, we can evolve
      more and faster than other species.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="111"><span class="styled-text">I also believe that all
      things in nature have innate attributes that are both good and bad, with their goodness and
      their badness depending on what they are used for. For example, the thorns on a rose bush,
      the stinger on a bee, the aggressiveness of a lion, the timidity of a gazelle are all both
      good and bad, depending on their applications. Over time, nature evolves toward the right
      balance through the process of natural selection—e.g., an overly aggressive animal will die
      prematurely, as will an overly timid animal. However, because man has the ability to look at
      himself and direct his own change, individuals have the capacity to evolve.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="112"><span class="styled-text">Most of us are born with
      attributes that both help us and hurt us, depending on their applications, and the more
      extreme the attribute, the more extreme the potential good and bad outcomes these attributes
      are likely to produce. For example, highly creative, goal-oriented people who are good at
      imagining the big picture often can easily get tripped up on the details of daily life, while
      highly pragmatic, task-oriented people who are great with the details might not be creative.
      That is because the ways their minds work make it difficult for them to see both ways of
      thinking. In nature everything was made for a purpose, and so too were these different ways
      of thinking. They just have different purposes. It is extremely important to one’s happiness
      and success to know oneself—most importantly to understand one’s own values and abilities—and
      then to find the right fits. We all have things that we value that we want and we all have
      strengths and weaknesses that affect our paths for getting them.</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">The most important quality that differentiates successful
      people from unsuccessful people is our capacity to learn and adapt to these
      things.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="113"><span class="styled-text">Unlike any other species,
      man is capable of reflecting on himself and the things around him to learn and adapt in order
      to improve. He has this capability because, in the evolution of the species, man’s brain
      developed a part that no other species has—the prefrontal cortex. It is the part of the human
      brain that gives us the ability to reflect and conduct other cognitive thinking. Because of
      this, people who can objectively reflect on themselves and others—most importantly on what
      their weaknesses are—can figure out how to get around these weaknesses, can evolve fastest,
      and can come closer to realizing their potentials than those who can’t.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="114"><span class="styled-text">However, typically
      defensive, emotional reactions—i.e., ego barriers—stand way of this progress. These reactions
      take place in the part of the brain called the amygdala. As a result of these reactions, most
      people don’t like reflecting on their weaknesses even though recognizing them is an essential
      step toward preventing the problems they cause. Most people especially dislike others
      exploring their weaknesses because it makes them feel attacked, which produces fight or
      flight reactions; however, having others help one find one’s weaknesses is essential because
      it’s very difficult to identify one’s own. Most people don’t like helping others explore
      their weaknesses, even though they are willing to talk about them behind their backs, For
      these reasons most people don’t do a good job of understanding themselves and adapting in
      order to get what they want most out of life. In my opinion, that is the biggest single
      problem of mankind because it, more than anything else, impedes people’s abilities to address
      all other problems and it is probably the greatest source of pain for most people.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="115"><span class="styled-text">Some people get over the
      ego barrier and others don’t. Which path they choose, more than anything else, determines how
      good their outcomes are. Aristotle defined tragedy as a bad outcome for a person because of a
      fatal flaw that he can’t get around. So it is tragic when people let ego barriers lead them
      to experience bad outcomes.</span></p>

      Process</span></h3>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="117"><span class="styled-text">As I mentioned before, I
      believe that life consists of an enormous number of choices that come at us and that each
      decision we make has consequences, so</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">the
      quality of our lives depends on the quality of the decisions we make.</span> <span class="styled-text"></span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="118"><span class="styled-text">We aren’t born with the
      ability to make good decisions; we learn it.</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="Of course it is true that people are born with differences in their various innate abilities. However, judgment is primarily learned." data-trigger="footnote"></button> <span class="styled-text">We all start off as children with
      others, typically parents, directing us. But, as we get older, we increasingly make our own
      choices. We choose what we are going after (i.e., our goals), which influences our
      directions. For example, if you want to be a doctor, you go to med school; if you want to
      have a family, you find a mate; and so on. As we move toward our goals, we encounter
      problems, make mistakes, and run into personal weaknesses. Above all else, how we choose to
      approach these impediments determines how fast we move toward our goals.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="119"><span class="styled-text">I believe that the way we
      make our dreams into reality is by constantly engaging with reality in pursuit of our dreams
      and by using these encounters to learn more about reality itself and how to interact with it
      in order to get what we want—and that if we do this with determination, we almost certainly
      will be successful. In short:</span></p>

      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="127"><span class="styled-text">So what is success? I
      believe that it is nothing more than getting what you want--and that it is up to you to
      decide what that is for you. I don’t care whether it’s being a master of the universe, a
      couch potato, or anything else--I really don’t. What is essential is that you are clear about
      what you want and that you figure out how to get it.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="128"><span class="styled-text">However, there are a few
      common things that most people want.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="129"><span class="styled-text">As I mentioned, for most
      people success is evolving as effectively as possible, i.e., learning about oneself and one’s
      environment and then changing to improve. Personally, I believe that personal evolution is
      both the greatest accomplishment and the greatest reward.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="130"><span class="styled-text">Also, for most people
      happiness is much more determined by how things turn out relative to their expectations
      rather than the absolute level of their conditions. For example, if a billionaire loses $200
      million he will probably be unhappy, while if someone who is worth $10,000 unexpectedly gets
      another $2,000, he will probably be happy. This basic principle suggests that you can follow
      one of two paths to happiness: 1) have high expectations and strive to exceed them, or 2)
      lower your expectations so that they are at or below your conditions. Most of us choose the
      first path, which means that to be happy we have to keep evolving.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="131"><span class="styled-text">Another principle to keep
      in mind is that people need meaningful work and meaningful relationships in order to be
      fulfilled.</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="As Freud put it, “Love and work are the cornerstones of our humanness.”" data-trigger="footnote"></button> <span class="styled-text">I have observed this to be true for virtually
      everyone, and I know that it’s true for me.</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="The work doesn’t necessarily have to be a job, though I believe it’s generally better if it is a job.

      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="134"><span class="styled-text">As I mentioned, as we
      head toward our goals we encounter an enormous number of choices that come at us, and each
      decision we make has consequences. So,</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">the
      quality of our lives depends on the quality of the decisions we make</span> <span class="styled-text">. We literally make millions of decisions that add up to the consequences that
      are our lives.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="135"><span class="styled-text">Of these millions, I
      believe that there are five big types of choices that we continually must make that radically
      affect the quality of our lives and the rates at which we move toward what we want. Choosing
      well is not dependent on our innate abilities such as intelligence or creativity, but more on
      what I think of as character. For this reason, I believe that most people can make the right
      choices.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="136"><span class="styled-text">The following five
      decision trees show these choices. I believe that those who don’t move effectively to their
      goals do the things on the top branches, and those who do move to them most quickly do the
      things on the bottom branches.</span></p>

      device to tell us that we are approaching, or that we have exceeded, our limits in some way.
      At the same time, nature made the process of getting stronger require us to push our limits.
      Gaining strength is the adaptation process of the body and the mind to encountering one’s
      limits, which is painful. In other words, both pain and strength typically result from
      encountering one’s barriers. When we encounter pain, we are at an important juncture in our
      decision-making process.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="140"><span class="styled-text">Most people react to pain
      badly. They have “fight or flight” reactions to it: they either strike out at whatever
      brought them the pain or they try run away from it. As a result, they don’t learn to find

They work as though they were two different brains that fight for control of decision-making. The pre-frontal cortex is the logical part of the brain that evaluates choices logically and the amygdala is the “animal instinct” part of the brain that triggers emotional reactions like the instinct to fight or flee. When faced with an obstacle or threat, an emotional reaction (e.g. pain) can be triggered that can lead to a fight or flight reaction that “hijacks” decision making away from the pre-frontal cortex, where the rational choices are being made. This can result in our making decisions that produce consequences that we do not want.

      a matter of personal choice and that, initially, making the right choices can be difficult.
      However, because of the law of nature that pushing your boundaries will make you stronger,
      which will lead to improved results that will motivate you, the more you operate in your

      infantrymen, one person to deliver the food, etc. While having the right design is essential,
      it is only half the battle. It is equally important to put the right people in each of these

      be fast runners, the snipers must be precise shots, etc. If your outcomes are inconsistent
      with your goals (e.g., if you are having problems), you need to modify your “machine,” which

      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="193"><span class="styled-text">There are five things
      that you have to do to get what you want out of life. First, you have to</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">choose your goals</span> <span class="styled-text">, which
      will determine your direction. Then you have to</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">design a plan</span> <span class="styled-text">to achieve
      your goals. On the way to your goals, you will</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">encounter problems</span> <span class="styled-text">. As I
      mentioned, these problems typically cause pain. The most common source of pain is in
      exploring your mistakes and weaknesses. You will either react badly to the pain or react like
      a master problem solver. That is your choice. To figure out how to get around these problems
      you must be calm and analytical to accurately</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">diagnose your problems</span> <span class="styled-text">.
      Only after you have an accurate diagnosis of them can you</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">design a plan that will get you around your problems</span>
      <span class="styled-text">. Then you have to do</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">the tasks</span> <span class="styled-text">specified in the
      plan. Through this process of encountering problems and figuring out how to get around them,
      you will become progressively more capable and achieve your goals more easily. Then you will
      set bigger, more challenging goals, in the same way that someone who works with weights
      naturally increases the poundage. This is the process of personal evolution, which I call my
      5-Step Process.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="194"><span class="styled-text">In other words, “The
      Process” consists of five distinct steps:</span></p>
      <p class="styled-text--bold commentary-indent" data-globalid="195" data-level="1">
         Have clear <span class="styled-text--bold styled-text--underline">goals.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="styled-text--bold commentary-indent" data-globalid="196" data-level="1">
          Identify and don’t tolerate the <span class="styled-text--underline">problems</span> that stand in the way of achieving your goals.
      </p>
      <p class="styled-text--bold commentary-indent" data-globalid="197" data-level="1">
          Accurately <span class="styled-text--underline">diagnose</span> these problems.
      </p>
      <p class="styled-text--bold commentary-indent" data-globalid="198" data-level="1">Design plans that explicitly lay out tasks that will get you around your problems and on to your goals.</p>
      <p class="styled-text--bold commentary-indent" data-globalid="199" data-level="1">Implement these plans—i.e., <span class="styled-text--underline">do</span> these tasks.</p>
      <p class="commentary so" data-globalid="200"><span class="styled-text">You need to do all of
      these steps well in order to be successful.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="201"><span class="styled-text">Before discussing these
      individual steps in more detail, I want to make a few general points about the
      process.</span></p>
      <p class="number" data-globalid="202" data-level="1" data-text="1"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold styled-text--sans-serif">You must approach these as distinct steps rather than blur
      them together.</span> <span class="styled-text">For example, when setting goals, just set
      goals (don’t think how you will achieve them or the other steps); when diagnosing problems,
      just diagnose problems (don’t think about how you will solve them or the other steps).
      Blurring the steps leads to suboptimal outcomes because it creates confusion and
      short-changes the individual steps. Doing each step thoroughly will provide information that
      will help you do the other steps well,</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">since the process is iterative.</span></p>
      <p class="number" data-globalid="203" data-level="1" data-text="2"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold styled-text--sans-serif">Each of these five steps requires different talents and
      disciplines.</span> <span class="styled-text">Most probably, you have lots of some of these
      and inadequate amounts of others. If you are missing any of the required talents and
      disciplines, that is not an insurmountable problem because you can acquire them, supplement
      them, or compensate for not having them, if you</span> <span class="styled-text">recognize your weaknesses and design around them.</span>
      <span class="styled-text">So you must be honestly self-reflective.</span></p>
      <p class="number" data-globalid="204" data-level="1" data-text="3"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold styled-text--sans-serif">It is essential to approach this process in a very
      clear-headed, rational way rather than emotionally.</span> <span class="styled-text">Figure
      out what techniques work best for you; e.g., if emotions are getting the better of you, take
      a timeout until you can reflect unemotionally, seek the guidance of calm, thoughtful others,
      etc.</span></p>
      <p data-globalid="205"><span class="styled-text">To help you do these
      things well—and stay centered and effective rather than stressed and thrown off by your
      emotions—try this technique for reducing the pressure:</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">treat your life like a game</span> <span class="styled-text">or a martial art. Your mission is to figure out how to get around your
      challenges to get to your goals. In the process of playing the game or practicing this
      martial art, you will become more skilled. As you get better, you will progress to
      ever-higher levels of the game that will require—and teach you—greater skills. I will explain
      what these skills are in the next section. However,</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">the big and really great news is that you don’t need to have
      all of these skills to succeed!</span> <span class="styled-text">You just have to 1) know
      they are needed; 2) know you don’t have some of them; and 3) figure out how to get them
      (i.e., either learn them or work with others who have them).</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="206"><span class="styled-text">This particular
      game—i.e., your life—will challenge you in ways that will be uncomfortable at times. But if
      you work through this discomfort and reflect on it in order to learn, you will significantly
      improve your chances of getting what you want out of life.</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">By and large, life will give you what you deserve and it
      doesn’t give a damn what you “like.” So it is up to you to take full responsibility to
      connect what you want with what you need to do to get it, and then to do those things—which
      often are difficult but produce good results—so that you’ll then deserve to get what you
      want.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="207"><span class="styled-text">That’s just the way it
      is, so you might as well accept it. Once you accept that playing the game will be
      uncomfortable, and you do it for a while, it will become much easier (like it does when
      getting fit). When you excel at it, you will find your ability to get what you want
      thrilling. You’ll see that excuses like “That’s not easy” are of no value and that it pays to
      “push through it” at a pace you can handle. Like getting physically fit, the most important
      thing is that you keep moving forward at whatever pace you choose, recognizing the
      consequences of your actions. When you think that it’s too hard, remember that in the long
      run, doing the things that will make you successful is a lot easier than being unsuccessful.
      The first-order consequences of escaping life’s challenges may seem pleasurable in the
      moment, but the second- and third-order consequences of this approach are your life and, over
      time, will be painful. With practice, you will eventually play this game like a ninja, with
      skill and a calm centeredness in the face of adversity that will let you handle most of your
      numerous challenges well.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="208"><span class="styled-text">However, you will never
      handle them all well: mistakes are inevitable, and it’s important to recognize and accept
      this fact of life. The good news, as I have mentioned, is that most learning comes through
      making mistakes—so there is no end to learning how to play the game better. You will have an
      enormous number of decisions to make, so no matter how many mistakes you make, there will be
      plenty of opportunities to build a track record of success.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="209"><span class="styled-text">That’s basically the
      whole concept.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="210"><span class="styled-text">Let’s pause and reflect
      on this before moving on.</span></p>
      <p class="question">
        <span data-globalid="211" data-id="11">Does what I am saying make sense to you?</span>
        <span data-globalid="212" data-id="12">Do you agree that it is true?</span>
        <span data-globalid="213" data-id="13">If not, why not?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="214"><span class="styled-text">If you can’t work through
      your doubts alone, speak to me or to others about it, but PLEASE do not proceed until you
      agree with the basic logic behind the 5-Step Process. Either you will get comfortable with it
      and internalize it or you will point out something that is wrong and the process will get
      better.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="215"><span class="styled-text">What follows now is a
      closer examination of each of the five steps.</span></p>
      <h3 class="commentary" data-globalid="216">The 5 Steps Close-Up</h3>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="217"><span class="styled-text--sans-serif">1)
      Setting Goals</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="218"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">You can
      have virtually anything you want, but you can’t have everything you want.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="219"><span class="styled-text">The first, most
      important, and typically most difficult step in the 5-Step Process is setting goals, because
      it forces you to decide what you really want and therefore what you can possibly get out of
      life. This is the step where you face the fundamental limit: life is like a giant smorgasbord
      of more delicious alternatives than you can ever hope to taste. So you have to reject having
      some things you want in order to get other things you want more.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="220"><span class="styled-text">Some people fail at this
      point, afraid to reject a good alternative for fear that the loss will deprive them of some
      essential ingredient to their personal happiness. As a result, they pursue too many goals at
      the same time, achieving few or none of them.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="221"><span class="styled-text">So it’s important to
      remember: it doesn’t really matter if some things are unavailable to you, because the
      selection of what IS available is so great. (That is why many people who had major
      losses—e.g., who lost their ability to walk, to see, etc.—and who didn’t narrow-mindedly
      obsess about their loss but rather open-mindedly accepted and enjoyed what remained, had
      equally happy lives as those who didn’t ever have these losses.)</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="222"><span class="styled-text">In other words, you can
      have an enormous amount: much, much more than what you need to have for a happy life. So
      don’t get discouraged by not being able to have everything you want, and for God’s sake,
      don’t be paralyzed by the choices. That’s nonsensical and unproductive. Get on with making
      your choices.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="223"><span class="styled-text">Put another way,</span>
      <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">to achieve your goals you have to prioritize, and
      that includes rejecting good alternatives</span> <span class="styled-text">(so that you have
      the time and resources to pursue even better ones—time being probably your greatest limiting
      factor, though, through leverage, you can substantially reduce time’s
      constraints).</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="224"><span class="styled-text">It is important not to
      confuse “goals” and “desires.”</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="225"><span class="styled-text">Goals are the things that
      you really want to achieve, while desires are things you want that can prevent you from
      reaching your goals—as I previously explained, desires are typically first-order
      consequences. For example, a goal might be physical fitness, while a desire is the urge to
      eat good-tasting, unhealthy food (i.e., a first-order consequence) that could undermine you
      obtaining your fitness goal. So, in terms of the consequences they produce, goals are good
      and desires are bad.</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="Some societies define evil to be the desires that can take you away from your goals, which I think is a good way of seeing the difference between goals and desires. That doesn’t mean I think that there isn’t room for a little “bad”, but I do think that desires that fundamentally divert you from your goals should be avoided at all cost." data-trigger="footnote"></button> <span class="styled-text"></span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="226"><span class="styled-text">Don’t get me wrong. I
      believe you can choose to pursue any goal you want as long as you consider the consequences.
      So, staying with this example, I think it is perfectly OK for you to make your goal to enjoy
      eating good-tasting, unhealthy food if that choice will bring you what you really want. As I
      said earlier, if you want to be a couch potato, that’s fine with me—seriously. But if that’s
      not what you want, you better not open that bag of chips. In other words, failing to make the
      distinction between goals and desires will lead you in the wrong direction, because you will
      be inclined to pursue things you want that will undermine your ability to get things you want
      more. In short, you can pursue anything you desire—just make sure that you know the
      consequences of what you are doing.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="227"><span class="styled-text">Another common reason
      people fail at this stage is that they lose sight of their goals, getting caught up in
      day-to-day tasks.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="228"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">Avoid
      setting goals based on what you think you can achieve.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="229"><span class="styled-text">As I said before, do each
      step separately and distinctly without regard to the others. In this case, that means don’t
      rule out a goal due to a superficial assessment of its attainability. Once you commit to a
      goal, it might take lots of thinking and many revisions to your plan over a considerable time
      period in order to finalize the design and do the tasks to achieve it. So you need to set
      goals without yet assessing whether or not you can achieve them.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="230"><span class="styled-text">This requires some faith
      that you really can achieve virtually anything,</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="This might sound inconsistent with the previous point that you can’t have everything. It’s not. I am saying that, at this stage of goal-setting, don’t set your goals based on what you think you can achieve. In the process of doing the other four steps (especially designing) you will thoroughly think through what is possible. Then you will circle back and enter the goal-setting mode again. As I mentioned, this five-step process is iterative, but it must be pursued one step at a time in order to do each step excellently." data-trigger="footnote"></button> <span class="styled-text">even if you don’t know how you
      will do it at that moment. Initially you have to have faith that this is true, but after
      following this process and succeeding at achieving your goals, you will gain confidence. If
      you like, you can start with more modest goals and, when you build up the track record to
      give you faith, increase your aspirations.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="231"><span class="styled-text">Every time I set goals, I
      don’t yet have any idea how I am going to achieve them because I haven’t yet gone through the
      process of thinking through them. But I have learned that I can achieve them if I think
      creatively and work hard.</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="The more creative I am, the less hard I have to work." data-trigger="footnote"></button> <span class="styled-text"></span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="232"><span class="styled-text">I also know that I can
      “cheat.” Unlike in school, in life you don’t have to come up with all the right answers. You
      can ask the people around you for help—or even ask them to do the things you don’t do
      well.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="233"><span class="styled-text">In other words, there is
      almost no reason you can't succeed if you take the attitude of 1) total flexibility—good
      answers can come from anyone or anywhere (and in fact, as I have mentioned, there are far
      more good answers “out there” than there are in you) and 2) total accountability: regardless
      of where the good answers come from, it’s your job to find them.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="234"><span class="styled-text">This no-excuses approach
      helps me do whatever it takes to get whatever I want most. Not all goals are achievable, of
      course. There are some impossibilities or near-impossibilities, such as living forever, or
      flying with just the power of your arms. But it’s been my experience that if I commit to
      bringing creativity, flexibility, and determination to the pursuit of my goals, I will figure
      out some way to get them, i.e., almost all goals are attainable. And as I don’t limit my
      goals to what seems attainable at the moment I set them, the goals I set tend to be higher
      than they would otherwise be. Since trying to achieve high goals makes me stronger, I become
      increasingly capable of achieving more. Great expectations create great capabilities, in
      other words. And if I fail to achieve my goal, it just tells me that I have not been creative
      or flexible or determined enough to do what it takes, and I circle back and figure out what I
      need to do about this situation.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="235"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">Achieving your goals isn’t just about moving
      forward.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="236"><span class="styled-text">Inevitably, you must deal
      with setbacks. So goals aren’t just those things that you want and don’t have. They might
      also be keeping what you do have, minimizing your rate of loss, or dealing with irrevocable
      loss. Life will throw you challenges, some of which will seem devastating at the time. Your
      goal is always to make the best possible choices, knowing that you will be rewarded if you
      do. It’s like playing golf: sometimes you will be in the fairway and sometimes you will be in
      the rough, so you have to know how to play it as it lies.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="237"><span class="styled-text">Generally speaking, goal
      setting is best done by those who are good at big-picture conceptual thinking, synthesizing,
      visualizing, and prioritizing. But whatever your strengths and weaknesses are, don’t forget
      the big and really great news here: it is not essential that you have all of these qualities
      yourself, because you can supplement them with the help of others.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="238"><span class="styled-text">In summary, in order to
      get what you want, the first step is to really know what you want, without confusing goals
      with desires, and without limiting yourself because of some imagined impediments that you
      haven’t thoroughly analyzed.</span></p>
      <p class="question">
        <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold" data-globalid="239" data-id="14">How well do you know what you want most out of life?</span>

      </p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="244"><span class="styled-text--sans-serif">2)
      Identifying and Not Tolerating Problems</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="245"><span class="styled-text">After you set your goals,
      you must come up with a plan or a design to achieve them and then you must execute that plan
      by doing the tasks. On the way to achieving your goals and executing your design, you will
      encounter problems that have to be diagnosed, so that the design can be modified to get
      around these obstacles. That’s why you need to identify and not tolerate problems.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="246"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">Most
      problems are potential improvements screaming at you.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="247"><span class="styled-text">Whenever a problem
      surfaces, you have in front of you an opportunity to improve.</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">The more painful the problem, the louder it is
      screaming.</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="Though I’ve said it before, it’s worth saying again: I understand that recognizing harsh realities can be extremely painful. But I’ve learned that if you can stare hard at your problems, they almost always shrink or disappear, because you almost always find a better way of dealing with them than if you don’t face them head on. The more difficult the problem, the more important it is that you stare at it and deal with it. After seeing how effectively facing reality – especially your problems, mistakes and weaknesses – works, you will become comfortable with it and won’t want to operate any other way.I also believe that one of the best ways of getting at truth is reflecting with others who have opposing views and who share your interest in finding the truth rather than being proven right." data-trigger="footnote"></button> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">In order to be
      successful, you have to 1) perceive problems and 2) not tolerate them.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="248"><span class="styled-text">If you don’t identify
      your problems, you won’t solve them, so you won’t move forward toward achieving your goals.
      As a result,</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">it is essential to bring
      problems to the surface.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="249"><span class="styled-text">Most people don’t like to
      do this. But most successful people know that they have to do this.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="250"><span class="styled-text">The most common reasons
      people don’t successfully identify their problems are generally rooted either in a lack of
      will or in a lack of talent or skill:</span></p>
      <p class="bullet" data-globalid="251" data-level="1"><span class="styled-text">Problems can

      weaknesses might be overcome with assistance or role changes. It doesn’t matter which is the

      Diagnosing the Problems</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="278"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">You
      will be much more effective if you focus on diagnosis and design rather than jumping to
      solutions.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="279"><span class="styled-text">It is a very common
      mistake for people to move directly from identifying a tough problem to a proposed solution
      in a nanosecond without spending the hours required to properly diagnose and design a
      solution. This typically yields bad decisions that don’t alleviate the problem. Diagnosing
      and designing are what spark strategic thinking.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="280"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">You
      must be calm and logical.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="281"><span class="styled-text">When diagnosing problems,
      as when identifying problems, reacting emotionally, though sometimes difficult to avoid, can
      undermine your effectiveness as a decision-maker. By contrast, staying rational will serve
      you well. So if you are finding yourself shaken by your problems, do what you can to get
      yourself centered before moving forward.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="282"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">You
      must get at the root causes.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="283"><span class="styled-text">Root causes, like
      principles, are things that manifest themselves over and over again as the deep-seated
      reasons behind the actions that cause problems. So you will get many everlasting dividends if
      you can find them and properly deal with them.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="284"><span class="styled-text">It is important to
      distinguish root causes from proximate causes. Proximate causes typically are the actions or
      lack of actions that lead to problems—e.g., “I missed the train because I didn’t check the
      train schedule.” Proximate causes are typically described via verbs. Root causes are the
      deeper reasons behind the proximate cause—e.g., “I didn’t check the schedule because I am
      forgetful.” Root cause. Root causes are typically described with adjectives, usually
      characteristics about what the person is like that lead them to an action or an
      inaction.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="285"><span class="styled-text">Identifying the real root
      causes of your problems is essential because you can eliminate your problems only by removing
      their root causes. In other words, you must understand, accept, and successfully deal with
      reality in order to move toward your goals.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="286"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">Recognizing and learning from one’s mistakes and the mistakes
      of others who affect outcomes is critical to eliminating problems.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="287"><span class="styled-text">Many problems are caused
      by people’s mistakes. But people often find it difficult to identify and accept their own
      mistakes. Sometimes it’s because they’re blind to them, but more often it’s because ego and
      shortsightedness make discovering their mistakes and weaknesses painful. Because people are
      often upset when their mistakes are pointed out to them, most people are reluctant to point
      out mistakes in others. As a result, an objective diagnosis of problems arising from people’s
      mistakes is often missing and personal evolution is stunted. (As I mentioned in the last
      chapter, most learning comes from making mistakes and experiencing the pain of them—e.g.,
      putting your hand on a hot stove—and adapting.) It is at this stage that most people fail to
      progress.</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">More than anything else, what
      differentiates people who live up to their potential from those who don’t is a willingness to
      look at themselves and others objectively.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="288"><span class="styled-text">I call the pain that
      comes from looking at yourself and others objectively “growing pains,” because it is the pain
      that accompanies personal growth. No pain, no gain. Of course, anyone who really understands
      that no one is perfect and that these discoveries are essential for personal growth finds
      that these discoveries elicit “growing pleasures.” But it seems to be in our nature to overly
      focus on short-term gratification rather than long-term satisfaction—on first-order rather
      than second- or third-order consequences—so the connection between this behavior and the
      rewards it brings doesn’t come naturally. However, if you can make this connection, such
      moments will begin to elicit pleasure rather than pain. It is similar to how exercise
      eventually becomes pleasurable for people who hardwire the connection between exercise and
      its benefits.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="289"><span class="styled-text">Remember that:</span></p>
      <figure class="center" data-globalid="290">
        <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">Pain + Reflection = Progress</span>
      </figure>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="291"><span class="styled-text">Much as you might wish
      this were not so, this is a reality that you should just accept and deal with. There is no
      getting around the fact that achieving success requires getting at the root causes of all
      important problems, and people’s mistakes and weaknesses are sometimes the root causes.
      So</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">to be successful, you must be willing
      to look at your own behavior and the behavior of others as possible causes of
      problems.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="292"><span class="styled-text">Of course, some problems
      aren’t caused by people making mistakes. For example, if lightning strikes, it causes
      problems that have nothing to do with human error. All problems need to be well-diagnosed
      before you decide what to do about them.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="293"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">The
      most important qualities for successfully diagnosing problems are logic, the ability to see
      multiple possibilities, and the willingness to touch people’s nerves to overcome the ego
      barriers that stand in the way of truth.</span></p>

      Designing the Plan (Determining the Solutions)</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="301"><span class="styled-text">In some cases, you might
      go from setting goals to designing the plans that will get you to these goals; while in other
      cases, you will encounter problems on the way to your goals and have to design your way
      around them. So design will occur at both stages of the process, though it will occur much
      more often in figuring out how to get around problems. In other words, most of the movement
      toward your goals comes from designing how to remove the root causes of your problems.
      Problems are great because they are</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">very
      specific</span> <span class="styled-text">impediments, so you know that you will move forward
      if you can identify and eliminate their root causes.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="302"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">Creating a design is like writing a movie script in that you
      visualize who will do what through time in order to achieve the goal.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="303"><span class="styled-text">Visualize the goal or
      problem standing in your way, and then visualize practical solutions. When designing
      solutions, the objective is to change how you do things so that problems don’t recur—or recur
      so often. Think about each problem individually and as the product of root causes—like the
      outcomes produced by a machine. Then think about how the machine should be changed to produce
      good outcomes rather than bad ones. There are typically many paths toward achieving your
      goals, and you need to find only one of them that works, so it’s almost always
      doable.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="304"><span class="styled-text">But an effective design
      requires thinking things through and visualizing how things will come together and unfold
      over time. It’s essential to visualize the story of where you have been (or what you have
      done) that has led you to where you are now and what will happen sequentially in the future
      to lead you to your goals. You should visualize this plan through time, like watching a movie
      that connects your past, present, and future.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="305"><span class="styled-text">Then write down the plan
      so you don’t lose sight of it, and include who needs to do what and when. The list of tasks
      falls out from this story (i.e., the plan), but they are not the same. The story, or plan, is
      what connects your goals to the tasks. For you to succeed, you must not lose sight of the
      goals or the story while focusing on the tasks; you must constantly refer back and forth. In
      My Management Principles (Part 3), you can see one such plan.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="306"><span class="styled-text">When designing your plan,
      think about the timelines of various interconnected tasks. Sketch them out loosely and then
      refine them with the specific tasks. This is an iterative process, alternating between
      sketching out your broad steps (e.g., hire great people) and filling these in with more
      specific tasks with estimated timelines (e.g., in the next two weeks choose the headhunters
      to find the great people) that will have implications (e.g., costs, time, etc.). These will
      lead you to modify your design sketch until the design and tasks work well together. Being as
      specific as possible (e.g., specifying who will do what and when) allows you to visualize how
      the design will work at both a big-picture level and in detail. It will also give you and
      others the to-do lists and target dates that will help direct you.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="307"><span class="styled-text">Of course, not all plans
      will accomplish everything you want in the desired time frame. In such cases, it is essential
      that you look at what won’t be accomplished and ask yourself if the consequences are
      acceptable or unacceptable. This is where perspective is required, and discussing it with
      others can be critical. If the plan will not achieve what’s necessary in the required time,
      so that the consequences have an unacceptably high probability of preventing you from
      achieving your goal, you have to either think harder (probably with the advice of other
      believable people) to make the plan do what is required or reduce your goals.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="308"><span class="styled-text">It doesn’t take much time
      to design a good plan—literally just hours spread out over days or weeks—and whatever amount
      of time you spend designing it will be only a small fraction of the time you spend executing
      it. But designing is very important because it determines what you will have to do to be
      effective. Most people make the very big mistake of spending virtually no time on this step
      because they are too preoccupied with execution. This process is explained in detail in my
      management principles.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="309"><span class="styled-text">People successful with
      this stage have an</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">ability to
      visualize</span> <span class="styled-text">and a</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">practical understanding</span> <span class="styled-text">of
      how things really work. Remember, you don’t have to possess all these qualities if you have
      someone to help you with the ones you are missing.</span></p>
      <p class="question" data-globalid="310" data-id="30"><span class="styled-text">How good is

      confident of your self-assessment, why should you be confident (e.g., do you have an
      excellent track record of visualizing and making what you visualized happen, have other

      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="313"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">Remember: Designing precedes doing!</span> <span class="styled-text">The design will give you your to-do list (i.e., the tasks).</span></p>

      Doing the Tasks</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="315"><span class="styled-text">Next, you and the others
      you need to rely on have to do the tasks that will get you to your goals. Great planners who
      don’t carry out their plans go nowhere. You need to “push through” to accomplish the goals.
      This requires the self-discipline to follow the script that is your design.</span>
      <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">I believe the importance of good work habits is
      vastly underrated.</span> <span class="styled-text">There are lots of books written about
      good work habits, so I won’t digress into what I believe is effective. However,</span>
      <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">it is critical to know each day what you need to
      do and have the discipline to do it</span> <span class="styled-text">. People with good work
      habits have to-do lists that are reasonably prioritized, and they make themselves do what
      needs to be done. By contrast, people with poor work habits almost randomly react to the
      stuff that comes at them, or they can’t bring themselves to do the things they need to do but
      don’t like to do (or are unable to do). There are lots of tools that can help (e.g., thank
      God for my BlackBerry!)</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="316"><span class="styled-text">You need to know whether
      you (and others) are following the plan, so you should establish clear benchmarks. Ideally
      you should have someone other than yourself objectively measure if you (and others) are doing
      what you planned. If not, you need to diagnose why and resolve the problem.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="317"><span class="styled-text">People who are good at
      this stage can reliably execute a plan. They tend to be</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">self-disciplined</span> <span class="styled-text">and</span>
      <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">proactive</span> <span class="styled-text">rather
      than reactive to the blizzard of daily tasks that can divert them from execution. They
      are</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">results-oriented: they love to push
      themselves over the finish line to achieve the goal</span> <span class="styled-text">. If
      they see that daily tasks are taking them away from executing the plan (i.e., they identify
      this problem), they diagnose it and design how they can deal with both the daily tasks and
      moving forward with the plan.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="318"><span class="styled-text">As with the other steps,
      if you aren’t good at this step, get help. There are many successful, creative people who are
      good at the other steps but who would have failed because they aren’t good at execution. But
      they succeeded nonetheless because of great symbiotic relationships with highly reliable
      task-doers.</span></p>

      explanation of doing what you set out to do, please see My Management Principles.</span></p>
      <p class="question" data-globalid="320" data-id="33"><span class="styled-text">How good are

      confident of your self-assessment, why should you be confident (e.g. because you have a
      demonstrated track-record, because many believable people have told you, etc)?</span></p>
      <h3 class="commentary" data-globalid="323">The Relationships between These Steps</h3>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="324"><span class="styled-text">Designs and tasks have no
      purpose other than to achieve your goals. Said differently, goals are the sole purpose of
      designs and tasks. So you mustn’t forget how they’re related. Frequently I see people feel
      great about doing their tasks while forgetting the goals they were designed to achieve,
      resulting in the failure to achieve their goals. This doesn’t make any sense, because the
      only purpose of tasks is to achieve goals. In order to be successful, your goals must be
      riveted in your mind: they are the things you MUST do. To remember the connections between
      the tasks and the goals that they are meant to achieve, you just have to ask, “Why?” It is
      good to connect tasks to goals this way (with the “Why?”), because losing sight of the
      connections will prevent you from succeeding.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="325"><span class="styled-text">Again, this 5-Step
      Process is iterative. This means that after completing one of the steps you will probably
      have acquired relevant information that leads you to modify the other steps.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="326"><span class="styled-text">If this process is
      working, goals will change much more slowly than designs, which will change more slowly than
      tasks. Designs and tasks can be modified or changed often (because you might want to reassess
      how to achieve the goal), but changing goals frequently is usually a problem because
      achieving them requires a consistent effort. I often find that people who have problems
      reaching their goals handle these steps backwards; that is, they stick too rigidly to
      specified tasks and are not committed enough to achieving their goals (often because they
      lose sight of them).</span></p>
      <h3 class="commentary">Weaknesses Don’t Matter if You Find
      Solutions</h3>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="328"><span class="styled-text">To repeat, the best
      advice I can give you is to ask yourself what you want, then ask ‘what is true,’ and then ask
      yourself ‘what should be done about it.’ If you honestly ask and answer these questions you
      will move much faster toward what you want to get out of life than if you don’t!</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="329"><span class="styled-text">Most importantly,</span>
      <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">ask yourself what is your biggest weakness that
      stands in the way of what you want.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="330"><span class="styled-text">As I mentioned before,
      everyone has weaknesses. The main difference between unsuccessful and successful people is
      that unsuccessful people don’t find and address them, and successful people do.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="331"><span class="styled-text">It is difficult to see
      one’s own blind spots for two reasons:</span></p>
      <p class="number" data-globalid="332" data-level="1" data-text="1"><span class="styled-text">Most people don’t go looking for their weaknesses because of “ego
      barriers”—they find having weaknesses painful because society has taught them that having
      weaknesses is bad. As I said early on, I believe that we would have a radically more
      effective and much happier society if we taught the truth, which is that everyone has
      weaknesses, and knowing about them and how to deal with them is how people learn and
      succeed.</span></p>
      <p class="number" data-globalid="333" data-level="1" data-text="2"><span class="styled-text">Having a weakness is like missing a sense—if you can’t visualize what it is,
      it’s hard to perceive not having it.</span></p>
      <p data-globalid="334"><span class="styled-text">For these two reasons,
      having people show you what you are missing can be painful, though it's essential for your
      progress. When you encounter that pain, try to remember that</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">you can get what you want out of life if you can
      open-mindedly reflect, with the help of others, on what is standing in your way and then deal
      with it.</span></p>
      <p class="question" data-globalid="335" data-id="36"><span class="styled-text">What do you
      think is the biggest weakness you have that stands in the way of what you want–the one that
      you repeatedly run into?</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="336"><span class="styled-text">People who don’t get what
      they want out of life fail at one or more of the five steps. But</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">being weak at any one of these steps is not a problem if you
      understand what you are weak at and successfully compensate for that weakness by seeking
      help</span> <span class="styled-text">. For example, a good goal-setter who is bad at doing
      tasks might work well with a bad goal-setter who is great at doing tasks—i.e., they will be
      much more successful working together. It is easy to find out what weaknesses are standing in
      your way by 1) looking at where you are failing and 2) getting the feedback of people who are
      successful at doing what you are having problems with.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="337"><span class="styled-text">Because I believe that
      you will achieve your goals if you do these five steps well, it follows that if you are not
      achieving your goals you can use the 5-Step Process as a diagnostic tool. You would do this
      by 1) identifying the step(s) that you are failing at, 2) noting the qualities required to
      succeed at that step, and 3) identifying which of these qualities you are missing.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="338"><span class="styled-text">To repeat, the five steps
      and the qualities that I believe are required to be good at them are as follows.</span></p>

      <p class="question" data-globalid="340" data-id="37"><span class="styled-text">At which step
      do you have the most problems?</span></p>
      <p class="question" data-globalid="341" data-id="38"><span class="styled-text">Which
      qualities needed do you wish you had more of?</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="342"><span class="styled-text">In a nutshell, my 5-Step
      process for achieving what you want is:</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="343"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">Values→
      1) Goals → 2) Problems → 3) Diagnoses → 4) Designs → 5) Tasks</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="344"><span class="styled-text">Your values determine
      what you want, i.e., your goals. In trying to achieve your goals, you will encounter problems
      that have to be diagnosed. Only after determining the real root causes of these problems can
      you design a plan to get around them. Once you have a good plan, you have to muster the
      self-discipline to do what is required to make the plan succeed. Note that this process
      starts with your values, but it requires that you succeed at all five steps. While these
      steps require different abilities, you don’t have to be good at all of them. If you aren’t
      good at all of them (which is true for almost everyone), you need to know what you are bad at
      and how to compensate for your weaknesses. This requires you to put your ego aside,
      objectively reflect on your strengths and weaknesses, and seek the help from
      others.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="345"><span class="styled-text">As you design and
      implement your plan to achieve your goals, you may find it helpful to consider
      that:</span></p>
      <p class="bullet" data-globalid="346" data-level="1"><span class="styled-text">Life is like a
      game where you seek to overcome the obstacles that stand in the way of achieving your
      goals.</span></p>
      <p class="bullet" data-globalid="347" data-level="1"><span class="styled-text">You get better
      at this game through practice.</span></p>
      <p class="bullet" data-globalid="348" data-level="1"><span class="styled-text">The game
      consists of a series of choices that have consequences.</span></p>
      <p class="bullet" data-globalid="349" data-level="1"><span class="styled-text">You can’t stop

      them.</span></p>
      <p class="bullet" data-globalid="350" data-level="1"><span class="styled-text">You have the
      freedom to make whatever choices you want, though it’s best to be mindful of their
      consequences.</span></p>
      <p class="bullet" data-globalid="351" data-level="1"><span class="styled-text">The pain of
      problems is a call to find solutions rather than a reason for unhappiness and inaction, so
      it’s silly, pointless, and harmful to be upset at the problems and choices that come at you
      (though it’s understandable).</span></p>
      <p class="bullet" data-globalid="352" data-level="1"><span class="styled-text">We all evolve
      at different paces, and it’s up to you to decide the pace at which you want to evolve.</span>

They speak of a comfort zone, a stretch zone and a panic zone. It’s best to spend most of your time in the stretch zone." data-trigger="footnote"></button> <span class="styled-text"></span></p>
      <p class="bullet" data-globalid="353" data-level="1"><span class="styled-text">The process
      goes better if you are as accurate as possible in all respects, including assessing your
      strengths and weaknesses and adapting to them.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="354"><span class="styled-text">While all this may sound
      very theoretical, it is integral to how we operate every day. For example, my management
      principles, which are explained in the next section, are based on the principles that I
      described in this section. So, Bridgewater is based on the core belief that everyone here is
      evolving together. How well and how quickly we do that will have a huge effect on our
      well-being and the well-being of all the people we have contact with (e.g., our clients, our
      families, etc.). These two things are inextricably linked. Bridgewater is also based on the
      belief that to be successful and happy, not only do we have to be excellent, we have to
      continue to improve at a surprisingly fast rate. Bridgewater operates consistently with the
      belief that to be excellent and improve at a fast rate, we must be hyper-realistic and
      hyper-truthful. We therefore need to overcome any impediments to being realistic and
      truthful, and the biggest impediment is people’s reluctance to face their own mistakes and
      weaknesses and those of others. Bridgewater is based on the belief that both meaningful work
      and meaningful relationships are required to be happy and successful. So, our relationships,
      like our work, must be excellent; as a result, we expect people to be extremely considerate
      and caring with each other. This does not mean being soft on each other, especially if that
      means avoiding harsh realities to avoid causing discomfort. It means true caring, which
      requires recognizing and successfully dealing with our realities, whatever they
      are.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="355"><span class="styled-text">The management principles
      that follow reflect these core values and the specific ways that they are lived out at
      Bridgewater.</span></p>

      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="357"><span class="styled-text">In Part 1 I explained why
      I believe having principles is important and that I believe that it is up to each person to
      decide what principles are best for them. In Part 2 I explained my most fundamental
      principles. In this part I explain my management principles. Naturally, my management
      principles reflect the principles I believe are best throughout my life. But before I get
      into my particular management principles, I’d like to touch on management principles in
      general.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="358"><span class="styled-text">If you read any of the
      earlier parts you know that I believe that having principles is essential for getting what
      you want out of life. That is as true for groups of people (e.g., companies, schools,
      governments, foundations, etc.) as it is for individuals. While individuals operating
      individually can choose whatever values and principles they like, when working in a group the
      people must agree on the group’s values and principles. If the group is not clear about them,
      confusion and eventually gravitation toward the population’s averages will result. If the
      group’s values and principles are clear, their way of being (i.e., their culture) will
      permeate everything they do. It will drive how the people in the group set goals, identify
      problems, diagnose problems, design solutions and make sure that these designs are
      implemented. So I believe this relationship looks like this:</span></p>

      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="360"><span class="styled-text">While having a clearly
      conveyed</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">great culture</span> <span class="styled-text">is important, that’s only half of the magic formula. The other half is
      having</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">great people</span> <span class="styled-text">—i.e., people who have the values, abilities, and skills that fit the
      organization’s culture.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="361"><span class="styled-text">In other words, I believe
      that to have a great company you have to make two things great—the</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">culture</span> <span class="styled-text">and the</span>
      <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">people</span> <span class="styled-text">. If
      these two things are great your organization can navigate the twists and turns to get you
      where you want to go.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="362"><span class="styled-text">Of course, you have to
      know where you want to go. Organizations, like individuals, have to choose what they are
      going after (i.e., their goals), which influences their directions. As they move toward their
      goals, they encounter problems, make mistakes and discover weaknesses. Above all else, how
      they choose to approach these impediments determines how fast they move toward their
      goals.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="363"><span class="styled-text">Every organization works
      like a machine to achieve its goals. This machine produces outcomes. By comparing the
      outcomes to the goals, those running the machine can see how well the machine is working.
      This is the</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">feedback loop</span>
      <span class="styled-text">that those who are responsible for the machine need to run well in
      order to improve the machine. Based on the feedback, the machine can be adjusted to improve.
      The machine consists of two big parts—the</span> <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">culture</span> <span class="styled-text">and the</span>
      <span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">people</span> <span class="styled-text">. If the
      outcomes are inconsistent with the goals, something must be wrong with the machine, which
      means that something must be wrong with the culture and/or the people. By diagnosing what is
      wrong, designing improvements and implementing those improvements, the machine will evolve.
      In short, the evolutionary process is as follows. Take a minute to look it over and see what
      you think.</span></p>

      evolutionary process—i.e., one in which mistakes are infrequently looked at and weaknesses
      are not well identified—looks like that shown below, i.e., fewer and/or less effective
      feedback loops produces a slower upward trajectory. In fact, if there are too few and/or bad
      quality feedback loops, there will be a decline because you won’t identify and deal with the
      problems that will kill you.</span></p>

      work best, which I explained in Part 2. Most importantly I value meaningful work and
      meaningful relationships that are obtained by striving for truth and excellence with great
      people. I am confident that through this constant striving, we will evolve rapidly
      together.</span></p>

      theory has been tested over the last 40 years and has worked. While 40 years ago being this
      way seemed logical, back then that was an untested theory. Now that we have 40 years of

      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="386"><span class="styled-text">The best advice I can
      give you is to ask yourself what do you want, then ask ‘what is true’—and then ask yourself
      ‘what should be done about it.’ I believe that if you do this you will move much faster
      toward what you want to get out of life than if you don’t!</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="387"><span class="styled-text">Because what I have said
      is pretty abstract, I need to spell out exactly what it means to run a company this way. I
      need to get very specific. Over time, I have collected and refined my principles so that they
      now encompass almost all aspects of management. I believe that virtually all problems you
      might encounter are addressed by one or more of the principles that follow.</span></p>
      <p class="commentary" data-globalid="388"><span class="styled-text">There are too many
      principles to read this as a book. What follows is not a few rules to go by presented in an

        accepting, and knowing how to effectively deal with reality are crucial for achieving
        success. Having truth on your side is extremely powerful. While the truth itself may be
        scary—you have a weakness, you have a deadly disease, etc.—knowing the truth will allow you
        to deal with your situation better. Being truthful, and letting others be truthful with
        you, allows you to explore your own thoughts and exposes you to the feedback that is
        essential for your learning. Being truthful is an extension of your freedom to be you;
        people who are one way on the inside and another on the outside become conflicted and often
        lose touch with their own values. It’s difficult for them to be happy, and almost
        impossible for them to be at their best. While the first-order effects of being radically
        truthful might not be desirable, the second- and third-order effects are great.</span></p>

        until you understand each other’s positions and can determine what should be done. As
        someone I worked with once explained, “It’s simple–just don’t filter.” The main reason
        Bridgewater performs well is that all people here have the power to speak openly and
        equally and because their views are judged on the merits of what they are saying. Through
        that extreme openness and a meritocracy of thought, we identify and solve problems better.
        Since we know we can rely on honesty, we succeed more and we ultimately become closer, and
        since we succeed and are close, we are more committed to this mission and to each other. It
        is a self-reinforcing, virtuous cycle.</span></p>

            thing you can do at Bridgewater. Criticism is both welcomed and encouraged at
            Bridgewater, so there is no good reason to talk behind people’s backs. You need to
            follow this policy to an extreme degree. For example, managers should not talk about
            people who work for them without those people being in the room. If you talk behind

            employees hide their employer’s mistakes, and employers do the same in return. In these
            places, openly expressing your concerns is considered disloyal, and is discouraged.
            Because it prevents people from bringing their mistakes and weaknesses to the surface
            and because it encourages deception and eliminates the subordinates’ right of appeal,
            unhealthy loyalty stands in the way of improvement. I believe in a truer, healthier
            form of loyalty, which does the opposite. Healthy loyalty fosters improvement through
            openly addressing mistakes and weaknesses. The more people are open about their
            challenges, the more helpful others can be. In an environment in which mistakes and
            weaknesses are dealt with frankly, those who face their challenges have the most
            admirable character. By contrast, when mistakes and weaknesses are hidden, unhealthy
            character is legitimized.</span></p>

        also tend to get angry at those who make mistakes because in a short-sighted way they focus

        <p class="commentary" data-globalid="424"><span class="styled-text">I once had a ski
        instructor who had taught Michael Jordan, the greatest basketball player of all time, how
        to ski. He explained that Jordan enjoyed his mistakes and got the most out of them. At the
        start of high school, Jordan was an unimpressive basketball player; he became a champion
        because he loved using his mistakes to improve. Yet despite Jordan’s example and the
        example of countless other successful people, it is far more common for people to allow ego
        to stand in the way of learning. Perhaps it’s because school learning overemphasizes the
        value of having the right answers and punishes wrong answers. Good school learners are
        often bad mistake-based learners because they are bothered by their mistakes. I
        particularly see this problem in recent graduates from the best colleges, who frequently
        shy away from exploring their own weaknesses. Remember that intelligent people who are open
        to recognizing and learning from their weaknesses substantially outperform people with the

        Everyone has weaknesses. The fastest path to success is to know what they are and how to
        deal with them so that they don’t stand in your way. Weaknesses are due to deficiencies in
        learning or deficiencies in abilities. Deficiencies in learning can be rectified over time,
        though usually not quickly, while deficiencies in abilities are virtually impossible to
        change. Neither is a meaningful impediment to getting what you want if you accept it as a

        the past). While people typically feel unhappy about blame and good about credit, that

        people because of ego sensitivities. This creates dysfunctional and dishonest

        differentiates those who evolve fast from those who don’t. When there is pain, the animal
        instinct is "fight or flight" (i.e., to either strike back or run away) -reflect instead.
        When you can calm yourself down, thinking about the dilemma that is causing you pain will
        bring you to a higher level and enlighten you, leading to progress. That is because the
        pain you are feeling is due to something being at odds-maybe it’s you encountering reality,
        such as the death of a friend, and not being able to accept it. If when you are calm, you
        can think clearly about what things are at odds, you will learn more about what reality is
        like and how to better deal with it. It really will produce progress. If, on the other
        hand, the pain causes you to tense up, not think, feel sorry for yourself, and blame
        others, it will be a very bad experience. So, when you are in pain, try to remember: Pain +
        Reflection = Progress. It’s pretty easy to determine whether a person is reflective or
        deflective: self-reflective people openly and objectively look at themselves while
        deflective people don’t.</span></p>

        <p class="commentary" data-globalid="471"><span class="styled-text">I believe that in all
        relationships, including the most treasured ones, 1) there are principles and values each
        person has that must be in synch for the relationship to be successful and 2) there must be
        give and take. I believe there is always a kind of negotiation or debate between people
        based on principles and mutual consideration. What you learn about each other via that
        “negotiation” either draws you together or drives you apart. If your principles are aligned
        and you can work out your differences via a process of give and take, you will draw closer
        together. If not, you will move apart. It is through such open discussion, especially when
        it comes to contentious issues, that people can make sure there are no misunderstandings.
        If that open discussion of differences doesn’t happen on an ongoing basis, the gaps in
        perspectives will widen until inevitably there is a major clash. Ironically, people who
        suppress the mini-confrontations for fear of conflict tend to have huge conflicts later,
        which can lead to separation, precisely because they let minor problems fester. On the
        other hand, people who address the mini-conflicts head-on in order to straighten things out
        tend to have the great, long-lasting relationships. That’s why I believe people should feel
        free to say whatever they really think.</span></p>

It is common for conversations to be exchanges of sentences that begin “I think…” followed by their conclusions, and both parties believing that they had a good conversation and feeling good about each other, even though nothing was accomplished.

            of us were trying to learn how to play golf with Tiger Woods, and he and a new golfer
            were debating how to swing the club. Would it be helpful or harmful to our progress to
            ignore their different track records and experience? Of course it would be harmful and
            plain silly to treat their points of view equally, because they have different levels
            of believability. It is better to listen to what Tiger Woods has to say, without
            constant interruptions by some know-nothing arguing with him. While I believe this is
            true, it would be most productive if Tiger Woods gave his instructions and then
            answered questions. However, because I’m pretty extreme in believing that it is
            important to obtain understanding rather than accepting doctrine at face value, I also
            think the new golfer shouldn’t accept what Tiger Woods has to say as right only because
            he has won loads of tournaments and has years of experience playing golf. In other
            words, I believe the new golfer shouldn’t stop questioning Tiger until he is confident
            he has found truth. At the same time, I also think the new golfer would be pretty dumb
            and arrogant to believe he’s probably right and the champion golfer is wrong. So he
            should approach his questioning with that perspective rather than overblown confidence.
            It would be really bad for the group’s learning if all the people in the group treated
            what the new golfer and Tiger Woods had to say as equally valuable. I feel exactly the
            same way about getting at truth at Bridgewater. While it’s good to be open-minded and
            questioning, it’s dumb to treat the views of people with great track records and
            experience the same as those without track records and experience.</span></p>

            communication is very important, the challenge is figuring out how to do it in a
            time-efficient way. It is helpful to use leveraging techniques like open e-mails posted
            on a FAQ board. If the reporting ratios are organized as described in the principles on
            organizational design, there should be ample time for this. The challenges become
            greater the higher you go in the reporting hierarchy because the number of people
            affected by your actions and who have opinions and/or questions grows larger than just
            two reporting levels down. In such cases, you will need even greater leverage and
            prioritization (e.g., having some of the questions answered by a well-equipped party
            who works for you, asking people to prioritize their questions by urgency or
            importance, etc.).</span></p>

        consequences. If you’re sick, you might choose to delegate the responsibility of figuring
        out what do to about it to a doctor. However, it is your responsibility to pick the right
        doctor because you will bear the consequences of that decision. While it is, of course,

        you still need to make sure that his incentives are aligned with his responsibilities and

    <p class="commentary" data-globalid="579"><span class="styled-text">In my many years of
    running Bridgewater, I have learned that people’s thinking abilities differ and that it is
    important to understand these differences so that they are appropriately considered when
    assigning people to roles. I have tried to find experts who understand these differences to
    help me better understand and test for them. I have found a few truly insightful people
    amid a mass of mediocrity.</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="I have particularly valued psychologist Bob Eichinger." data-trigger="footnote"></button> <span class="styled-text">I have also found that there are all sorts
    of theories from all sorts of people about how people think and why, so very little should
    be treated as fact. It seems that “political correctness” and the reluctance to objectively
    discuss differences in innate abilities have stood in the way of forthright and thoughtful
    research on this important subject. While the search for good advice and tests has been
    challenging, it has also been invaluable. What follows is a mix of my theories based on my
    personal observations and a collection of valuable things I have learned from
    others.</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="I am convinced that we are just scratching the surface of understanding differences in how people think and how to test for it, so there is great potential for others to follow this path. Unfortunately, most of the world’s experts I have met are more theoretical than practical." data-trigger="footnote"></button> <span class="styled-text">I know I have only scratched
    the surface of learning about how people think, why they think differently, and how to test

    <p class="commentary" data-globalid="580"><span class="styled-text">I believe, but am not
    certain about, the following:</span></p>
    <p class="bullet" data-globalid="581" data-level="1"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">There are two big differences in how people think that are
    due to the brain’s coming in two big halves and different people relying differently on
    them. <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="A good book on this is A Whole New Mind by Daniel H. Pink, and a good article on the science of this is “A Wandering Mind Heads Straight Toward Insight” by Robert Lee Hotz from The Wall Street Journal." data-trigger="footnote"></button></span> <span class="styled-text">This was explained by Caltech
    Professor Roger Sperry, who won a Nobel Prize in medicine for attributing these two ways of
    thinking to different reliances on the two hemispheres. As a result of this discovery,
    these two ways of thinking are called “left-brained” and “right-brained.” Professor Sperry
    helped us understand that:</span></p>
    <p class="bullet" data-globalid="582" data-level="2"><span class="styled-text">The left
    hemisphere reasons sequentially, analyzes details, and excels at linear analysis.
    Left-brained thinkers do these things well. They are also called linear thinkers. When they

    <p class="bullet" data-globalid="583" data-level="2"><span class="styled-text">The right
    hemisphere reasons holistically, recognizes themes, and synthesizes the big picture.
    Right-brained thinkers do these things well. People who think this way are also called
    lateral thinkers. Those who excel at this kind of thinking are called “smart.”</span>
    <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="“Smart” people have common sense, are good at synthesizing, and can imagine what is possible." data-trigger="footnote"></button></p>
    <p class="commentary" data-globalid="584"><span class="styled-text">Long before I knew that

    <p class="question">
        <span class="styled-text" data-globalid="585" data-id="41">On a scale of -5 to +5–left-brained to right-brained–where do you think you fall?</span>
        <span class="styled-text" data-globalid="586" data-id="42">How confident are you that your self-assessment is right?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="bullet" data-globalid="587" data-level="1"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">Some people see details (trees), and others see big
    pictures (forests).</span> <span class="styled-text">Those who “see trees” see the parts
    most vividly and don’t readily relate the parts to each other in order to see the big
    picture—e.g., they might prefer more literal, precise paintings. They are typically
    left-brained. Others connect the dots to pictures. In fact, they typically don’t even see
    the dots; they just see the pictures. They are typically right-brained. You can detect
    which type people are by observing what they focus on. Detailed thinkers can lose sight of
    the big picture and are more likely to focus in on a part than to go to the higher level
    and see the relationship between parts. For example, a person who focuses on details can be
    thrown off by word mistakes like “there“ instead of “their,” while big-picture thinkers
    won’t even notice the mistake. Similarly, big-picture thinkers can often understand the
    meaning of sentences even when key words are reversed—e.g., when “up” is mistakenly used
    instead of “down,” they understand that the person speaking couldn’t have meant “up” in
    that context. That is because their attention is focused on the context first and the
    details second. When describing the same meeting, these two different types will frequently
    focus on completely different things and disagree on their interpretations. In discussions,
    they can frustrate each other and discount what the other is saying. Similarly, a person of
    one type interviewing another type will usually yield an unsatisfactory result.</span></p>

    </p>
    <p class="bullet" data-globalid="590" data-level="1"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">Some people rely more on remembering what they were taught
    when making decisions, and others rely more on their independent reasoning.</span>
    <span class="styled-text">Let’s call the first group memory-based learners and the second
    group reasoning-based thinkers. When using the word “learning” I intend to convey
    “acquiring knowledge by being taught,” and when using the word “thinking” I mean “figuring
    it out for oneself.” Memory-based learners approach decision-making by remembering what
    they were taught. They draw on their memory banks and follow the instructions stored there.
    They are typically left-brained. Reasoning-based thinkers pay more attention to the
    principles behind what happens. They are typically right-brained. You can tell the
    difference when what is learned (e.g., CAPM) conflicts with what is logical (e.g., All
    Weather). People who rely on memory-based learning will typically be more skeptical of
    unconventional ideas because their process is to more readily accept what they have been
    told and because they are less able to assess it for themselves. Those who rely on more on
    reasoning won’t care much about convention and will assess ideas on their merits. Those who
    rely on memory-based learning also tend to align themselves with the consensus more than
    people who rely on reasoning. Memory-based learners are more willing to accept the status
    quo, while reasoning-based thinkers are less biased by it. They are more likely to be
    innovative, while those who rely on learning are likelier to be cautious. Performance in
    school will correlate well with the quality of one’s learning-based thinking, but will not
    reliably correlate with one’s reasoning-based thinking. The most able learners are easily
    found, since they are, or were, the best students from the best schools. The best thinkers
    are tougher to find, as there are no obvious funnels through which they pass, especially
    before they develop track records in the “real world.”</span></p>

    are typically right-brained thinkers. By contrast, those who are focused on the daily tasks
    are better at managing things that don’t change much or require repetitive processes done
    reliably, and are typically best at doing clearly specified tasks. They see things much
    more literally and tend to make incremental changes that reference what already exists.

    readily adapt to it. Perceivers see things happening and work backward to understand the
    cause and how to respond; they work from the outside in; they also see many more
    possibilities that they compare and choose from; often they see so many that they are
    confused by them. In contrast, planners work from the inside out, figuring out first what
    they want to achieve and then how things should unfold. Planners and perceivers have
    trouble appreciating each other. While a perceiver likes to see new things and change
    directions often, this is discomforting to planners, who prefer to stick to a plan.
    Planners weigh precedent much more heavily in their decision-making, and assume that if it
    was done before in a certain way, it should be done again in the same way, while perceivers
    tend to optimize on the spot. Planners are typically left-brained, and perceivers are

        someone who has years of experience, without confirming whether he has demonstrated the
        qualities of an outstanding plumber. Yet the difference between hiring an ordinary versus
        an extraordinary plumber (or any other expert) is huge. So when reviewing a candidate’s
        background, you must identify how this person has demonstrated himself to be outstanding.
        The most obvious demonstration is outstanding performance within an outstanding peer group.
        If you’re less than excited to hire someone for a particular job, don’t do it. The two of

        leads to confused and inefficient decision-making. It can also lead you in conflicting

        wildly differing assumptions, or 2) you have unresolved differences in your views of how
        things should proceed and why. Getting in synch by discussing who will do what and why is
        essential for mutual progress. It doesn’t necessarily entail reaching a consensus. Often
        there will be irreconcilable differences about what should be done, but a decision still
        needs to be made, which is fine. The process of getting in synch will make it clear what is
        to be done and why, even if it cannot eliminate difference. One of the most difficult and
        most important things you must do, and have others do, is bring forth disagreement and work
        through it together to achieve a resolution. Recognize that this process takes time. It can
        happen any way people prefer: discussion, e-mail, etc. You must have a workable process for
        making decisions even when disagreements remain. I discuss such a process in the earlier

        <p class="commentary" data-globalid="732"><span class="styled-text">Escalating means saying
        that you don’t believe that you can successfully handle a situation and that you are
        passing the “responsible party” (RP) job to someone else. The person you are escalating
        to—the person to whom you report—can then decide whether to coach you through it, take
        control, have someone else handle it, or do something else. However, the boss should avoid
        being drawn into doing the job of the person who is failing without exploring why the job
        has not been done successfully without help. It’s very important to get an accurate
        assessment of what each person can and can’t do and why. If the boss just does the job for
        the person, even if it produces good results, we will lack the right attribution of success
        and failure. Remember that an important goal is to learn about what a person is like from
        testing, and that we want to get that information without crashing the car. So, the RP must
        either say that he can handle his job or that he cannot. And it is the responsibility of
        the boss to make the assessment of whether to remove the RP from the driver’s seat because
        he might crash. We learn from mistakes by seeing our failures, feeling the pain of them,
        and reflecting and gaining insight. If the boss and the RP don’t recognize the RP’s
        failures to fix things, and the RP lacks the ability to do the job, trouble will result.
        Remember that life is the best teacher—“the proof is in the pudding.” So going through this
        process is essential to real learning.</span></p>

            Example: One day I told one of the new research people what a good job I thought he was
            doing and how strong his thinking was. It was a very positive initial evaluation. A few
            days later I heard him chatting away for hours about stuff that wasn’t related to work,
            so I spoke to him about the cost to his and our development if he regularly wasted
            time. Afterward I learned he took away from that encounter the idea that I thought he
            was doing a horrible job and that he was on the brink of being fired. But my comment
            about his need for focus had nothing to do with my overall evaluation of him. If I had
            explained myself when we sat down that second time, he could have better put my

            <p class="commentary" data-globalid="786"><span class="styled-text">People don’t like
            to face their weaknesses. At Bridgewater, because we always seek excellence, more time
            is spent discussing weaknesses. Similarly, problems require more time than things that
            are going well. Problems must be figured out and worked on, while things that are
            running smoothly require less attention. So we spend a lot of time focusing on people’s
            weaknesses and problems. This is great because we focus on improving, not celebrating
            how great we are, which is, in fact, how we get to be great. For people who don’t
            understand this fact, the environment can be difficult. It’s therefore important to 1)
            clarify and draw attention to people’s strengths and what’s being done well; and 2)
            constantly remind them of the healthy motive behind this process of exploring
            weaknesses. Aim for complete accuracy in your assessments. Don’t feel you have to find
            an equal number of “good and bad” qualities in a person. Just describe the person or
            the circumstances as accurately as possible, celebrating what is good and noting what
            is bad.</span></p>

            should be constant, reviews are periodic. The purpose of a review is to review the
            employee's performance and to state what the person is like as it pertains to their
            doing their job.</span></p>
            <p class="commentary" data-globalid="791"><span class="styled-text">A job review should
            have few surprises in it—this is because throughout the year, if you can’t make sense
            of how the person is doing their job or if you think it’s being done badly, you should
            probe them to seek understanding of root causes of their performance. Because it is
            very difficult for people to identify their own weaknesses, they need the appropriate
            probing (not nitpicking) of specific cases by others to get at the truth of what they
            are like and how they are fitting into their jobs.</span></p>
            <p class="commentary" data-globalid="792"><span class="styled-text">From examining
            these specific cases and getting in synch about them, agreed-upon patterns will emerge.
            As successes and failures will occur in everyone (every batter strikes out a lot), in
            reviewing someone the goal is see the patterns and to understand the whole picture
            rather than to assume that one or a few failures or successes is representative of the
            person. You have to understand the person’s modus operandi and that to be successful,
            they can’t be successful in all ways—e.g., to be meticulous they might not be able to
            be fast (and vice versa). Steve Jobs has been criticized as being autocratic and
            impersonal, but his modus operandi might require him being that way, so the real choice
            in assessing his fit for his job is to have him the way he is or not at all: that
            assessment must be made in the review, not just a theoretical assessment that he should
            do what he is doing and be less autocratic.</span></p>
            <p class="commentary" data-globalid="793"><span class="styled-text">In some cases, it
            won’t take long to see what a person is like—e.g., it doesn’t take long to hear if a
            person can sing. In other cases, it takes a significant number of samples and time to
            reflect on them. Over time and with a large sample size, you should be able to see what
            people are like, and their track records (i.e., the level and the steepness up or down
            in the trajectories that they are responsible for, rather than the wiggles in these)
            will paint a very clear picture of what you can expect from them.</span></p>
            <p class="commentary" data-globalid="794"><span class="styled-text">If there are
            performance problems, it is either because of design problems (e.g., the person has too
            many responsibilities) or fit/abilities problems. If the problems are due to the
            person’s inabilities, these inabilities are either because of the person’s innate
            weaknesses in doing that job (e.g., if you are 5-foot-2, you probably shouldn’t be a
            center on the basketball team) or because of inadequate training to do the job. A good
            review, and getting in synch throughout the year, should get at these
            things.</span></p>

        </div>
        <p class="commentary" data-globalid="799"><span class="styled-text">Your career path isn’t
        planned because the evolutionary process is about discovering your likes and dislikes as
        well as your strengths and weaknesses. The best career path for anyone is based on this
        information. In other words, each person’s career direction will evolve differently based
        on what we all learn. This process occurs by putting people into jobs that they are likely
        to succeed at, but that they have to stretch themselves to do well. They should be given
        enough freedom to learn and think for themselves while being coached so they can be taught
        and prevented from making unacceptable mistakes. During this process they should receive
        constant feedback. They should reflect on whether their problems can be resolved by
        additional learning or stem from innate qualities that can’t be changed. Typically it takes
        six to 12 months to get to know a person in a by-and-large sort of way and about 18 months
        to change behavior (depending on the job and the person). During this time, there should be
        periodic mini-reviews and several major ones. Following each of these assessments, new
        assignments should be made to continue to train and test them. They should be tailored to
        what was learned about the person’s likes and dislikes and strengths and weaknesses. This
        is an iterative process in which these cumulative experiences of training, testing, and
        adjusting direct the person to ever more suitable roles and responsibilities. It benefits
        the individual by providing better self-understanding and greater familiarity with various
        jobs at Bridgewater. This is typically both a challenging and rewarding process. When it
        results in a parting of ways, it’s usually because people find they cannot be excellent and
        happy in any job at Bridgewater or they refuse to go through this process.</span></p>

            <p class="commentary" data-globalid="803"><span class="styled-text">Since there is no
            such thing as perfection, even excellent managers, companies, and decisions will have
            problems. It’s easy, though often not worth much, to identify and dwell on tiny
            mistakes. In fact, this can be a problem if you get bogged down pinpointing and
            analyzing an infinite number of imperfections. At the same time, minor mistakes can
            sometimes be manifestations of serious root causes that could cause major mistakes down
            the road, so they can be quite valuable to diagnose. When assessing mistakes it is
            important to 1) ask whether these mistakes are manifestations of something serious or
            unimportant and 2) reflect on the frequency of them. An excellent decision-maker and a
            bad decision-maker will both make mistakes. The difference is what causes them to make
            mistakes and the frequency of their mistakes.</span></p>
            <p class="commentary" data-globalid="804"><span class="styled-text">There is also a
            difference between “I believe you made a bad decision” and “I believe you are a bad
            decision-maker,” which can be ascertained only by seeing the pattern. Any one event has
            many different possible explanations, whereas a pattern of behavior can tell you a lot
            about root causes. There are many qualities that make up a person. To understand each
            requires 1) a reliable sample size and 2) getting in synch (i.e., asking the person why
            and giving feedback). Some qualities don’t require a large sample size—e.g., it takes
            only one data point to know if a person can sing—and others take multiple observations
            (five to 10). The number of observations needed to detect a pattern largely depends on
            how well you get in synch after each observation. A quality discussion of how and why a
            person behaved a certain way should help you quickly understand the larger
            picture.</span></p>

        first case, the learning is stored in the conscious mind, and the medical student draws on
        his memory bank to remember what he has learned. In the second case, what the doctor has
        learned through hands-on experience is stored in the subconscious mind and pops up without
        his consciously recalling it from the memory bank. People who excel at book learning tend
        to call up from memory what they have learned in order to follow stored instructions.
        Others who are better at internalized learning use the thoughts that flow from their
        subconscious. The experienced skier doesn’t recite instructions on how to ski and then
        execute them; rather, he does it well “without thinking,” in the same way he breathes

        <p class="number" data-globalid="902" data-level="1" data-text="1"><span class="styled-text">Issues log: A problem or “issue” that should be logged is easy to identify:
        anything that went wrong. The issues log acts like a water filter that catches garbage. By
        examining the garbage and determining where it came from, you can determine how to
        eliminate it at the source. You diagnose root causes for the issues log the same way as for
        a drilldown (explained below) in that the log must include a frank assessment of individual
        contributions to the problems alongside their strengths and weaknesses. As you come up with
        the changes that will reduce or eliminate the garbage, the water will become cleaner. In
        addition to using issues logs to catch problems, you can use them to measure the numbers
        and types of problems, and they can therefore be effective metrics of performance. A common
        challenge to getting people to use issues logs is that they are sometimes viewed as
        vehicles for blaming people. You have to encourage use by making clear how necessary they
        are, rewarding active usage, and punishing non-use. If, for example, something goes wrong
        and it’s not in the issues log, the relevant people should be in big trouble. But if
        something goes wrong and it’s there (and, ideally, properly diagnosed), the relevant people
        will probably be rewarded or praised. But there must be personal accountability.</span></p>
        <p class="number" data-globalid="903" data-level="1" data-text="2"><span class="styled-text">Metrics: Detailed metrics measure individual, group, and system performance.
        Make sure these metrics aren’t being “gamed” so that they cease to convey a real picture.
        If your metrics are good enough, you can gain such a complete and accurate view of what
        your people are doing and how well they are doing it that you can nearly manage via the
        metrics. However, don’t even think of taking the use of metrics that far! Instead, use the
        metrics to ask questions and explore. Remember that any single metric can mislead. You need
        enough evidence to establish patterns. Metrics and 360 reviews reveal patterns that make it
        easier to achieve agreement on employees’ strengths and weaknesses. Of course, the people
        providing the information for metrics must deliver accurate assessments. There are various
        ways to facilitate this accuracy. A reluctance to be critical can be detected by looking at
        the average grade each grader gives; those giving much higher average grades might be the
        easy graders. Similarly helpful are “forced rankings,” in which people must rank coworker
        performance from best to worst. Forced rankings are essentially the same thing as “grading
        on a curve.” Metrics that allow for independent grading across departments and/or groups
        are especially valuable.</span></p>

        relationships. Because it starts and ends with how you approach mistakes, I hope that I
        have conveyed why I believe this attitude about and approach to dealing with mistakes is so
        important.</span></p>

        </div>
        <p class="commentary" data-globalid="983"><span class="styled-text">A drilldown is the
        process by which someone who wants to do so can gain a deep enough understanding of the
        problems in an area as well as the root causes, so that they can then go on to design a
        plan to make the department or sub-department excellent. It is not a “diagnosis,” which is
        done for each problem. A manager doing ongoing diagnosis will naturally understand his
        areas well and won’t have to do a drilldown. Drilling down is a form of probing, though it
        is broader and deeper. Done well, it should get you almost all the information needed to
        turn a department around in about five hours of effort.</span></p>
        <p class="commentary" data-globalid="984"><span class="styled-text">A drilldown takes place
        in two distinct steps: 1) listing problems and 2) listing causes/diagnosing. It is followed
        by 3) designing a plan. If done well, getting informed via the first two steps typically
        takes about four hours (give or take an hour or so), with the first step of listing the
        problems typically taking one to two hours and the second step of diagnosing them typically
        taking two to four hours, if done efficiently.</span></p>
        <p class="commentary" data-globalid="985"><span class="styled-text">It’s very important
        that these steps are done separately and independently. That’s because going into two or
        three directions at the same time causes confusion and doesn’t allow adequate discussion of
        each of the possible causes and solutions.</span></p>
        <p class="commentary" data-globalid="986"><span class="styled-text">Having the people from
        the area under scrutiny actively participate in all three steps is critical. You need to
        hear their descriptions and allow them to argue with you when they think you are wrong.
        This way you are much more likely to come up with an accurate diagnosis and a good
        plan.</span></p>
        <p class="commentary" data-globalid="987"><span class="styled-text">After the drilldown,
        you will create the plan or design, which typically takes two to three hours. So the whole
        process, from asking the first question to coming up with the detailed plan, typically
        takes about five to night hours spread over three or four meetings. Then there is step
        four—the executing, monitoring, and modifying of the plan—which typically takes six to 12
        months.</span></p>
        <p class="commentary" data-globalid="988"><span class="styled-text">Here is more detail on
        each of the steps:</span></p>
        <p class="commentary" data-globalid="989"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">Step
        1—List the problems.</span> <span class="styled-text">Don’t confuse problems with possible
        solutions. Sometimes problems occur for rare or insignificant reasons because nothing is
        perfect. Don’t pay much attention to those. But more often than not, they are symptomatic
        of something malfunctioning in your machine, so it pays to investigate what that is. For
        example, not having enough capacity is not a “problem”; it might cause problems, but it’s
        not a problem. Having people work so late that they might quit, getting out reports too
        late, etc., might be problems that are caused by a lack of capacity. But the lack of
        capacity itself is not a problem. To fix problems, you need to start with the specific
        problems and address them one by one and come up with very specific solutions. That’s
        because there are lots of ways to solve problems. The problem of people working late at
        night might be solved by gaining capacity, or it might be solved by shifting work to
        another department, or by doing less, etc. To assume that lack of capacity is the problem
        could lead to inferior problem-solving. So unless you keep in mind the very specific
        problems, you will not be effective at solving them. In the process of solving problems,
        you will often see that several problems are due to the same cause (e.g., lack of capacity,
        a shortage of tech resources, bad management, etc.), but that is not the same thing as
        starting at the more general level (like saying that bad management or lack of capacity,
        etc., are problems), which is why I am saying you must start with very specific problems
        before making generalizations. For example, when you have a “people problem,” be specific.
        Specify which people you are having what problems with and avoid the tendency of saying
        things like, “People in operations aren’t…” Avoid the tendency not to name names for fear
        of offending.</span></p>
        <p class="commentary" data-globalid="990"><span class="styled-text styled-text--bold">Step
        2—Identify root causes.</span> <span class="styled-text">Root causes are the deep-seated
        reasons behind the actions that caused the problems. It is important to distinguish between
        proximate causes, which are superficial reasons for what happened (e.g., “I missed the
        train because I didn’t check the train schedule”), and root causes (e.g., “I didn’t check
        the schedule because I am forgetful”). Typically a proximate cause is the action that led
        to the problem while a root cause is the fundamental reason that action occurred. So, when
        diagnosing, if you are describing what happened or didn’t happen to cause the problem, you
        are probably describing proximate causes. When you start describing the qualities that were
        behind these actions, you are probably getting at the root causes. To get at the root
        cause, keep asking why. For example, if the problem is that people are working late and the
        direct cause was that there wasn’t enough capacity, then ask why there wasn’t enough
        capacity. Then you will get closer to the root cause.</span></p>
        <p class="commentary" data-globalid="991"><span class="styled-text">If your machine is
        producing outcomes that you don’t want, either the design is flawed or the parts/people
        that you dropped into the design are malfunctioning. Most, but not all, problems happen
        because 1) it isn’t clear who the “responsible party” is for making sure things go
        well</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="Which would be because the manager—the responsible party for making it clear who is responsible for what—is failing to do that well." data-trigger="footnote"></button> <span class="styled-text">or 2) the responsible party
        isn’t handling his or her responsibilities well (in other words, isn’t operating according
        to the principles to eliminate the problem). So first ask, “Is it clear who the responsible
        party is?” If not, specify that. If it is clear, then ask, “Why isn’t he or she doing a
        good job?” There are two possible reasons for someone doing a poor job: insufficient
        training or insufficient ability.</span></p>
        <p class="commentary" data-globalid="992"><span class="styled-text">Though it is essential
        to connect problems to the responsible parties, this can be difficult if the responsible
        parties don’t acknowledge their mistakes and fail to diagnose why they made the mistakes.
        Still, clarity about responsibility and the problems’ root causes must be achieved because
        otherwise there is no hope for improvement. If the responsible parties do not explicitly
        take responsibility for ensuring that their areas operate smoothly, their areas will not
        operate smoothly. An important first step toward achieving clarity is to remove the
        mentality of blame and credit, because it stands in the way of accurately understanding
        problems, and that’s a prerequisite for producing improvements. Also, it is important not
        to judge too quickly what the root causes are. Instead, you should observe the patterns of
        problems using the issues log as a tool and discuss with the responsible parties what the
        root causes might be each time a problem arises. You probably won’t initially be able to
        come to conclusions with a high degree of confidence, because there are many possible
        reasons for any one problem. But over time, the problems’ patterns and causes will become
        clear to everyone.</span></p>
        <p class="commentary" data-globalid="993"><span class="styled-text">As mentioned, there are
        two possible reasons why the responsible party handled something badly: 1) the responsible
        party didn’t encounter this problem enough times previously to learn from it and prevent it
        in the future (by using the principles) or 2) the responsible party is unsuited for that
        job. And there are also two possible reasons the person is not suited for that job: 1) not
        enough experience or training and 2) lack of values and/or abilities required to do the job
        well. So getting at the root causes is largely a matter of figuring out:</span></p>
        <p class="number" data-globalid="994" data-level="1" data-text="1"><span class="styled-text">Who is the responsible party for what went wrong?</span></p>
        <p class="number" data-globalid="995" data-level="1" data-text="2"><span class="styled-text">Did that person encounter the problem enough times that he or she should have
        either learned how not to repeat it or elevated it to someone who could have helped learn
        how to solve it? The conclusions could be the following: 1) If the person did encounter the
        problem enough times to have resolved or elevated it, then the person is not suitable for
        the job</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="That doesn’t mean that all people have to solve and prevent all repeating problems or they shouldn’t be in their jobs. That might not be possible because smaller, repeating problems might be consciously accepted until they become high enough priorities to be fixed. However, it does mean that repeating problems should be recognized and, if not able to be resolved, they must be elevated." data-trigger="footnote"></button> <span class="styled-text">; 2) if the person did not
        encounter the problems enough times to resolve or elevate it, what are the probable root
        causes? The most common root causes are: 1) the person is not suitable for the job in some
        way (doesn’t learn from mistakes, doesn’t have a high sense of responsibility, is lazy,
        etc.); 2) the design of the process is flawed (e.g., the person is doing things in a way
        that can be improved); or 3) there is no possible solution. If it’s the first root cause,
        the person should have their job changed; if it’s the second, you and the person need to
        properly diagnose the problem and come up with a different process that will work; and if
        it’s the third, you won’t know that until you have thoroughly explored whether the process
        can be remediated.</span></p>
        <p class="commentary" data-globalid="996"><span class="styled-text">That second alternative
        of trying to find a better process takes time and patience (involving you and the person
        properly diagnosing the problem and finding a different approach that works). Normally,
        this is the point at which most companies and people fail. That is because people often
        take the identification of a “mistake” as the equivalent of an accusation that they are
        flawed (dumb, lazy, etc.), so they become defensive. If instead they view the exercise as
        an investigation into how the process might be flawed, it’s easier to make progress. So
        when criticizing, it’s sometimes helpful to convey explicitly the point of the exercise:
        mutually diagnosing the problem and exploring the pros and cons of alternative approaches.
        You both need to be mindful that doing this well typically takes time and patience. One of
        the purposes of the brainstorming session is to do this, ideally with an agreed diagnosis
        resulting from it.</span></p>

        <p class="commentary" data-globalid="1015"><span class="styled-text">Before moving forward,
        take the time to reflect on how the machine worked. By diagnosing what went right and what
        went wrong (especially what went wrong), you can see how the machine is operating and how
        it should be improved. People who are just focused on what they should do next are overly
        focused on the tasks at hand and not on how the machine is working; so they don’t make

        <p class="commentary" data-globalid="1016"><span class="styled-text">Go back by “telling
        the story” to help put things in perspective. Sometimes people have problems putting
        current conditions into perspective or projecting into the future. Sometimes they disagree
        on cause-effect relationships, or focus on details rather than addressing the big picture.
        Sometimes they forget who or what caused things to go well or poorly. By asking them to
        “tell the story” of how we got here, or by “telling the story” yourself, you put where you
        are in perspective. Doing this highlights important items that were done well or poorly in
        relation to their consequences, draws attention to the overarching goals, and helps achieve
        agreement. By telling the story from the past to the present, it will help you continue it
        into the future (i.e., design a plan). Making a good plan involves sketching out the
        important events through time and thinking through the specifics in sequence so that when
        you are done, the final story is vivid and easy to visualize. Then other people can
        understand the plan, comment on it, and eventually believe in it. It’s also required for
        specifying who should do what and when.</span></p>

        levels and themes going on in any one conversation. It is important to know how to navigate
        them. If you imagine main points and subordinate points organized in outline form, an
        above-the-line discussion addresses the main points. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t
        reference details, because some details might be necessary to the discussion. But reference
        details solely for the purpose of understanding major points rather than dissecting minor
        points.</span></p>
        <p class="commentary" data-globalid="1021"><span class="styled-text">For example, suppose
        your major point is: “Sally can do that job well.” In an above-the-line conversation, the

        soon as agreement was reached on whether she could perform competently, you would pass to
        the next major point—such as what qualities are required for that job. In contrast, a
        below-the-line discussion would focus on Sally’s qualities for their own sake, without
        relating them to whether she can do her job well. The discussion might cover qualities that
        are irrelevant to the job. While both levels of discussion touch on minor points, “above
        the line” discourse will always move coherently from one major point to the next in much
        the same way as you can read an outline in order to fully understand the whole concept and
        reach a conclusion. You go “below the line” to the minor points only to illustrate
        something important about the major points and progress in an orderly and accurate way to
        the conclusion. Your ability to do this is partially innate but can be improved with

        <p class="commentary" data-globalid="1045"><span class="styled-text">A good designer is
        able to visualize the machine and its outcomes accurately, though imperfectly. First
        visualize the parts and their interactions, and then find the parts to fit the design. Look
        at all the system’s pieces and their interactions. Imagine how goals 1, 2, and 3 can be
        achieved. Imagine how Harry, Larry, and Sally can operate in various ways with various
        tools and different incentives and penalties in place to achieve those goals. Then imagine
        how the system would work differently if you replaced Harry with George, or if it was
        configured in an entirely different way. Do this iteratively. Think through what the
        products and people and finances will look like month by month (or quarter by quarter) over
        the next year given one system; then change the system and visualize the outcomes again. At
        the end of this process, your plan should look like a realistic movie script, which
        describes the parties and their interactions through time. Remember that everything takes
        longer and costs more than you plan for. Recognize that some people are relatively better
        or worse at visualization. Accurately assess your own abilities and those of others so you
        can use the most capable people to create the visualization.</span></p>

        <p class="commentary" data-globalid="1047"><span class="styled-text">The outcome you get as
        a first-order consequence might be desirable (or undesirable), while the second- or
        third-order consequences could be the opposite, so focusing solely on first-order
        consequences, which people tend to do, could lead to bad decision-making. Though I might
        not like the first-order consequences of a rainy day, I might love the second-order
        consequences. So if I were in a position to choose whether or not there should be rainy
        days, I would need to look at the second- and third-order consequences to make the right
        decision. For example, for every person you plan to hire, you will have to hire more to
        support them. I call this “The 1.6 Effect.” as you’ll have to bring on another 0.6 of a

        </div>
        <p class="commentary" data-globalid="1049"><span class="styled-text">As an example of
        building the organization around goals rather than tasks, we have traditionally had a
        marketing department (goal: to market) that is separate from our client service department
        (goal: to service clients), even though they do similar things and there would be
        advantages to having them work together. But because marketing and servicing clients are
        two distinct goals, we have a separate department for each. If they were merged, the
        department head, salespeople, client advisors, analysts, and others would be giving and
        receiving conflicting feedback. If asked why clients were receiving relatively poor
        attention, the answer might be: “We have incentives to raise sales.” Asked why they weren’t
        making sales, the merged department might explain that they need to take care of their
        clients. Keeping the two areas separate gives each department a clear focus and the
        appropriate resources to achieve its goals, makes the diagnosis of resource allocations
        more straightforward, and reduces “job slip.” Of course, when building departments around
        goals, your goals have to be the right size to warrant these resources. An organization
        might not be big enough to warrant having a few salesmen and its own analytical group.
        Bridgewater has successfully evolved from a one-cell organization, in which most people
        were involved in everything, to the current multi-cell organization because we retained our
        ability to efficiently focus as the organization grew. Also, I want to make clear that
        temporarily sharing or rotating resources is OK, and is not the same thing as a merging of
        responsibilities. I will discuss merging later in this document, as well the coordination
        required to maintain focus in large organizations.</span></p>

            <p class="commentary" data-globalid="1062"><span class="styled-text">Here’s an example
            of the confusion that can arise when that understanding is absent: It was proposed that
            the head of technology have the facilities group (the people who take care of
            facilities like the building, lunches, office supplies, etc.) report to him because
            both are, in a sense, “facilities” and because they have some things in common, such as
            the electrical supply. But the head of technology didn’t understand what the facilities
            people do. Having people who are responsible for the janitorial services and meals
            reporting to a technology manager is as inappropriate as having the technology people
            report to the person who is taking care of facilities. These functions, even if they’re
            considered “facilities” in the broadest sense, are very different, as are the
            respective skill sets. Similarly, at another time, we talked about combining folks who
            work on client agreements with those who do counterparty agreements under one manager.
            That would have been a mistake because the skills required to reach agreements with
            clients are very different from the ones required to reach agreements with
            counterparties. It was wrong to conflate both departments under the general heading of
            “agreements,” because each kind called for specific knowledge and skills.</span></p>

            but a “supreme master” manager can even hire a person or two to do this and has
            achieved such leverage that things are effortlessly running superbly. Of course, there
            is a continuum related to this. The main message I’m trying to convey is that managers
            should strive to hire, train, and oversee in a way in which others can superbly handle
            as much as possible on their own. Managers should view the need to get involved in the

            will see the differences in people’s performances and make much more rapid improvement.

            <p class="commentary" data-globalid="1141"><span class="styled-text">I often observe
            people giving opinions as soon as they have them, which seems at about the point that
            they think there’s more than a 50% chance of them being right. Often they don’t pay any
            attention to the value of raising the probability of being right (e.g., from 51% to
            85%) by reflecting harder on whether the answer is right and doing the investigations
            and double-checking with others to make sure that the answer is right. Remember that,
            in an expected value sense, raising the probability of being right (e.g., from 51% to
            85%) can be worth more than just going from probably being wrong (e.g., 45%) to
            probably being right (e.g., 51%) because we are all playing probabilities. Think about
            the effects of altering the probabilities of achieving must-do's: if you have a 51%
            probability of handling a “must-do” correctly, it means that only a bit more than half
            of your must-do's will be done appropriately, whereas an 85% probability of handling a
            decision well means that only 15% of the must-do's will be handled badly.</span></p>

        hours,” which could lead to a discussion of whether Sally and Bill are working too long,
        which derails the discussion. Because nothing is 100% true, conversations can get off track

        that the statement is by and large true. To avoid this problem, the person making such

        <p class="commentary" data-globalid="1170"><span class="styled-text">To do this well, you
        have to synthesize what is going on. Usually it takes diagnosing a few (e.g., five or so)
        dots of the same type to get at the true root cause so that you can see how the machine
        should be modified to produce better outcomes. For example, one type of outcome involves
        someone, let’s call him Harry, handling a type of responsibility (entering an order). You
        will need at least a few experiences to learn about Harry doing this. It will pay for you
        to understand Harry and his handling of orders and have him understand you by looking
        objectively at the outcomes and by getting in synch, especially about the bad outcomes. The
        quality of your understanding of your machine and its constituent parts will depend on how
        well you diagnose and process the important outcomes. If you don’t do this continuously and
        you don’t synthesize well, you will fail. This isn’t easy.</span></p>
        <p class="commentary" data-globalid="1171"><span class="styled-text">See how the dots
        connect through time. This requires collecting, analyzing, and sorting lots of different
        types, and it ain’t easy for most folks. Imagine a day in which eight outcomes occur. Some
        are good, some bad. Let’s represent this day as follows, with each type of event
        represented by a letter and the quality of the outcome represented by its
        height.</span></p>

        </figure>
        <p class="commentary" data-globalid="1173"><span class="styled-text">In order to see the
        day this way, you must categorize outcomes by type and quality, which will require
        synthesizing a “by and large” assessment of each. If you didn’t examine the bad outcomes as
        they occurred, you couldn’t understand what they are symptomatic of. Keep in mind our
        example is a relatively simple one: only eight occurrences over one day. Now let’s look at
        what a month looks like.</span></p>
        <p class="commentary" data-globalid="1174"><span class="styled-text">Confusing, eh? Some
        people are much better at this than others.</span></p>

        <p class="commentary" data-globalid="1176"><span class="styled-text">In order to understand
        how your machine is working to achieve your goals, you have to perceive change over time,
        charting improvement versus deterioration. The chart below plots just the type X dots,
        which you can see improving. As mentioned in the section on diagnosis, you must categorize,
        understand, and observe the evolution of the different parts of your machine through time,
        and synthesize this understanding into a picture of how your machine is working and how it
        should be improved. People who do this well are rare and essential. As with most abilities,
        synthesizing well is partially innate and partially learned through practice.</span></p>

        <p class="commentary" data-globalid="1179"><span class="styled-text">I often hear people
        say, “It’s getting better,” as though that is good enough when “it” is both below that bar
        and improving at an inadequate rate. That isn’t good enough. For example, if someone who
        has been getting 30s and 40s on tests raised his grade to the 50s, you could say he’s
        improving, but the level is still woefully inadequate. Everything important you manage has
        to be on a trajectory to be “above the bar” and headed for “excellent” at an acceptable
        pace. For example, in the chart below, the trajectory of A might be acceptable, but B’s
        trajectory is not. A gets us above the bar in an acceptable amount of time.</span></p>

        achieve high standards. This is particularly difficult when two uncompromisable things are
        at odds. At such times, there is a tendency to let one of them go. However, at such times,
        you have to allocate more time to figure out how to best handle this, be more creative, and
        ask for more input. But don’t compromise on one of the things that shouldn’t be
        compromised. For example, one of the uncompromisable things I regularly get pressure from
        people to compromise on is letting great people avoid exploring their mistakes and
        weaknesses because they find it painful. For reasons articulated throughout these
        principles, I believe we can’t compromise on this because that process of exploration is
        healthy for Bridgewater, healthy for them, and key to our culture. I also believe that to
        allow opt-outs would legitimatize two sets of rules and put our radically honest way of
        being in jeopardy. But I want great people.</span> <button class="btn btn--footnote js-trigger footnote" data-footnote="Everyone is wrestling with some things, but most people don’t talk about them—some people don’t like to probe you about your weaknesses because they think it’s unkind or awkward.
